GIN,"Cucumber and mint is a fashionable combination in cocktails,
[especially] those with Hendrick’s gin, which has a cucumber flavor.
Cucumber is a flavor that’s distinct yet delicate, and very refreshing. It
goes beautifully with a range offoods, from Asian cuisine to smoked
salmon.
— JERRI BANKS, COCKTAIL CONSULTANT (NEW YORK CITY)"
GIN,"With gin, or even Martini & Rossi Bianco, I love the combination of
blackberries and sage. Blackberries have an indescribable flavor to
begin with, and the sage gives them a brooding quality.

Because ofits delicacy, to make the mayonnaise I’ll use a neutral oil that’s a blend of 80 percent canola and 20 percent olive. It finds a counterpoint in lemon and fines herbes, and gets a note offreshness, crunch, and spicy heat from radishes. — TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)"

MACADAMIA NUTS,"Our macadamia nut tart, which we serve with banana-rum ice cream, is
our take on pecan pie.
— LISSA DOUMANI, TERRA (ST. HELENA. CALIFORNIA)"
MACADAMIA NUTS,"Macadamia nuts are buttery, rich nuts. I will even pair them with sea scallops, which also have a richness to them. The macadamia nuts don’t overwhelm the scallops and I put them in the dish slightly chopped — otherwise, the texture ofthe nut would be too chewy. We use macadamia nuts on one ofthe simplest yet most popular dishes on our menu — our jumbo lump crab cake with grilled asparagus and toasted macadamia nuts. Our crab cake is the only recipe we won’t give out. It contains no herbs or spices. The only thing that goes in our crab cake is crab, salt, pepper, panko [Japanese bread crumbs], and a little mayonnaise to hold them together. You are the first people to get this recipe! — MARCEL DESAULNIERS. THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)"

I am working on miso-avocado puree as well. It is delicious, but I just haven’t found the right dish for it yet. I am also working with miso-huitlacoche soup with tofu, mushrooms, or com. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)"
MISO AND MISO SOUP,"I love miso. I went to a Japanese restaurant and loved the miso soup. I realized that it would give more flavor than chicken broth to my onion soup. So now I make a miso broth the night before, let it sit and separate, and use the broth for my onion soup. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)"
MISO AND MISO SOUP,"I will use several different misos, depending on the purpose. I might use saikyo, a light, yellow, sweet miso, in marinades or with lighter fish like sweet shrimp and scallops that would be overwhelmed by dark miso. Barley miso is a distinctive strong, sweet miso that I’ll use with nigiri with baby squid and shiso. I’ll use wheat miso with foie gras. Sometimes I’ll even mix misos. — KAZ OKOCHI, KAZ SUSHI BISTRO (WASHINGTON, DC)"

"VINEGAR, SHERRY","The minute sherry vinegar is added to a dish, the music gets turned up. It's not just its flavor, but its aroma as well. It makes things sizzle. It is not just when it is used in salads, but it is also the spark that makes gazpacho the unique soup it is. It is the spark that makes a humble lentil stew made with carrots, garlic, onion, and water a new thing. At the end, you add just a touch ofvinegar and you have this wonderful flavor that sparkles. . . . We have made sorbet out ofsherry vinegar and what you get is something that makes ""the king ofrefreshing” even more refreshing! You can go either savory or sweet with this sorbet: You could serve orange segments with the sherry sorbet on top, a touch of olive oil, an anchovy, a couple ofblack olives, and you have a salad. Or you could take the same oranges, add a touch ofhoney on top, manchego cheese, the sherry vinegar sorbet, and have a sweet dessert. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFS ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)"
"VINEGAR, SHERRY","For our meat dishes, we deglaze with vinegar or veijus — and most often it will be sherry vinegar. That’s my workhorse vinegar for hot dishes. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)"
"VINEGAR, SHERRY","There is a range ofsherry vinegar from light to heavy, and I use them all. I love sherry vinegar on almost all vegetables, but especially asparagus and cucumbers. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)"

WINTER,"I think of beef and pork as winter meats. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)"
WINTER,"With my desserts, I focus on chocolate all year round, but use it even more in winter. In California, the fruit is so wonderful in the summer that that is the place to focus. In summer, I can write my whole menu and forget chocolate — that is how good the fruit is here! In winter, it is the opposite. There are not eight unique things to focus on. So chocolate comes into play because it is a real comfort food and warming, too. Winter with its cool nights becomes souffle season. Winter is when all the special citrus fruits are available. Thank God for that, because you can work with Cara Cara oranges, lemon, and tropical fruits like passion fruit. Mangoes are available year-round, but winter is when I use them because there’s no competition from berries and other summer fruits. What is great about the tropical fruits in winter is that they also bring color to the menu. Pies and tarts work year-round because you can put anything in them, from chocolate to fruit. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)"
