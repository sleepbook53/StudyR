Almonds,Coment,"Almonds are fairly versatile in that their flavor is not very specific. When they are manufactured, then they have a distinct flavor think of Frangelico, almond oil, or marzipan in dessert. In these cases, the almond has a very distinct flavor. — MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG. VIRGINIA)",,,
Almonds,Coment,"Ifyou have some beautiful almonds, there are so many things you can do. You can grind them and make a frangipane and put it in puff pastry. You can put them into biscotti, a cake, or almond ice cream. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

ANCHOVIES,Coment,"No country in the world has anchovies like Spain. They are sophisticated, and the ones from the north of Spain are best because they are bigger. Spanish anchovies are not salty, either. Once you eat one, your life changes forever! I pay a lot for my anchovies — up to seventy-five cents per fillet — and will have to charge $9 for a plate. My customers will say that is too much to pay, and I agree — but ifyou don’t pay, you don’t taste. Lately, I have been combining anchovies with nectarines, which I love. I will make a vinaigrette with Pedro Ximenez [i.e., PX sherry], sherry vinegar, and olive oil and it is the perfect dressing — and unique. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFfz ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

"ANISE, STAR",Coment,"As a kid, I hated black jelly beans. But I have grown to like all the various forms ofanise, and star anise is one ofmy favorites. My favorite application is when it is infused with milk chocolate. It then has an almost malty-caramely quality to it. It adds that little something that people can’t quite identify. I also love pears with anise, which works well with roasted or poached pears. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",SPICE,,

APPLES,Coment,"The combination of apple and celery works. A tart green apple sorbet is not going to knock your socks off, because you are programmed to know it. When you add the flavor of celery, you get something new. I also love the flavors of apple and fennel together, especially in sorbet. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
APPLES,Coment,"I make an apple confit ofthinly sliced apples with cinnamon caramel powder layered between the apples and baked slowly. When the dish is served, next to the apples is a small pile ofdates poached in syrup with vanilla. The other flavors on the plate are lemon confit, quince, raw apple with apple cider gelee, and ras el hanout (a Moroccan spice blend). For this dish you need a contrast for the sweetness, so the role of the lemon confit is to cleanse and refresh. Ifthe confit was not there, you would have a bite ofthe sweet date and be done. The date and lemon is like a salad. The line drawing this together is the quince and dates that come from the Middle East and that was the line to ras el hanout. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
APPLES,Coment,"If you cook apples on top ofthe stove, some varieties will have a lot of juice while others will have none at all. Fuji, Gala, and Golden Delicious apples tend to be juicy, while Granny Smith apples are often drier. With different types of apples, you often don’t know exactly what they will do. So ifI’m going to serve apples with gingerbread, I will saute them in a little sugar and see what happens. Ifthey are letting out a bunch ofjuice, I won’t add much sugar. Ifthey are dry, I’ll add some apple juice or Calvados. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
APPLES,Coment,"When 1 make an apple pie, I won’t use any fewer than three different kinds of apples for their different textures and sweetnesses, which ensures that every single bite is interesting. I’ll use Galas or Golden Delicious apples for their sweetness in the middle ofthe pie, and soft Jonathans or Mclntoshes on top for their ability to melt into the others, and Braebums or Granny Smiths on the bottom for their ability to stay firm. ... I can’t imagine an apple pie without cinnamon, a splash of lemon juice, and a pinch ofsalt. — SHARON HACE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,Citrus,
APPLES,Coment,"Apples and caramel are a wonderful combination and depending on what nut you add it will take the combination in very different directions. Ifyou add pecans, it would make the combination a heavier winter dessert, versus adding almonds, which would keep it lighter. Both work; you just need to decide how heavy you want the dish. — EMILY LUCHETTI. FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

APPLES,Coment,"Ifyou stay in the boundaries ofwhat people think a dessert should be it gets very hard to do something new. We explain that they already eat carrot cake. We think parsnip will work instead of carrot and that kabocha squash will work instead of pumpkin in a pie. When people see eggplant in a dessert they automatically think it will not work. You have to hide the unusual element and play up what people know already. The boundaries are limitless when you think of all the crossovers between sweet and savory. Duck a 1'orange is a fruit and meat combined, so why not use bacon in a dessert? A pancake with maple syrup and bacon on the plate is really sweet and savory. So people already eat these combinations unconsciously. For our apple-eggplant dessert, we start with a choux dough piecrust. Then we layer an almond cream-like custard. Then we alternate apple and eggplant slices side by side. We use baby eggplant because it has a spongy texture and sucks up moisture from the cream that can otherwise make the crust soggy and absorb the juice and flavor from the apples that would normally just evaporate. So when you eat the eggplant and apples, the eggplant tastes like apples. — DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)",,,
APPLES,Coment,"I have always been very fond of chef Fredy Girardet [who earned three Michelin stars at his restaurant in Switzerland before retiring in 1996]. When I was young, I cooked almost every recipe from his book and visited his restaurant. One of his most interesting desserts was an apple dessert made of apples in the shape oflittle balls. The dessert broke away from cooking apples whole in the traditional way, which alone inspired me. He cooked them over a very high heat for two minutes and put them into a red wine reduction that had cinnamon, orange peel, and sugar. This was put onto a sheet tray that needed to be shaken for an hour so the apples would not dry out. The apples would absorb these flavors like a sponge and would then be served with vanilla ice cream. In that spirit, we transformed this dessert. We transformed the wine by “espherication” so that it creates a bubble ofliquid that explodes in your mouth. We cut apples with a melon bailer, then vacuum-packed the apples with the wine but cooked it in such a way that the apples stayed hard and absorbed the wine flavor. — JOSE ANDRES, CAF£ ATLANTIC© (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,ORANGE
APPLES,Coment,"We serve a dish ofsmoked oysters with apples. We smoke the oysters over applewood, and so it seemed logical to add apple to the dish. We serve it with a puree of apple with juniper that just plays beautifully off the oyster. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

APRICOTS — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Apricots are much better cooked than raw. It is rare that you find a fruit that reaches its full potential as cooked rather than raw, but an apricot is one. A so-so apricot poached will turn into heaven. They are great with either chamomile or lavender. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
APRICOTS — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Apricot is a fruit you need to cook to help unleash its flavors. A bite of raw apricot is kind of bland and doesn’t excite very much. Ifyou throw that same apricot into the oven and heat it up a bit, it turns into a whole different fruit. Apricot with vanilla is a match made in heaven. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

Panko bread crumbs are mixed with chopped mint, salted, and stuffed into tire artichoke cavity. The homemade mayonnaise I serve is made with eggs and just a little olive oil but mostly melted butter, which makes it richer and more flavorful — which is based on how it is made for the Chinese dish of shrimp and walnuts. The mayonnaise is then seasoned with anchovies, red pepper flakes, and onion confit. — TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

ASPARAGUS,RECIPE,"Daniel Humm of New York's Eleven Madison Park on Making Asparagus Soup
Making and seasoning soup is one of the
best ways to learn about flavor. Let's make
asparagus soup.
• You need a lot of asparagus flavor.
• You need acidity.
• You need sweetness that will come
from the asparagus.
• You need the right amount of salt.
• You need just the right amount of
spice, so that it doesn't actually taste
spicy. We use a lot of cayenne, but
you would never know it is there; it is
just an accent.
• You need fresh lime juice to finish.
Soup is a play of balance when you have
a lot of flavor. You can add a lot of salt
and it won't taste salty. You can add a lot
of acid and it won’t taste acidic. But you
still have a bold-flavored soup. It’s like
winemaking; at some point, there is a balance of all the flavors.
The first thing you need to do is get
all the asparagus flavor into the soup at
the start. We save our asparagus liquid
from all the asparagus we cook to use
for asparagus stock.
Making the soup: We sweat the asparagus [that is, cook it over low heat in a
little fat, generally in a covered pot or
pan] very slowly. When we add wine, we
do it multiple times, adding a little at a
time and reducing it, then repeating the
process. What this does is concentrate the
flavor at each step. It makes a big difference [before adding the asparagus liquid].
Finishing the soup: A soup may taste
seasoned, but it still needs to be ""woken
up.” You taste the asparagus, but maybe
it doesn't blow you away at first. To do
that, you need acid and cayenne. We season the soup with lime because it is a
stronger acid and yet has less flavor than

AUSTRIAN CUISINE,Coment,"In the autumn, I use walnut vinegar, which is red wine vinegar with macerated walnuts in it. It is great on a dish ofsweetbreads and hazelnuts. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,
AUSTRIAN CUISINE,Coment,"When I think of autumn, I think of apples, pears, quince — which is so underrated — figs, and pumpkins. I work with apples and pears, which you can start using in September, especially with the early apples like Gravenstein in the Bay Area. I try not to use pumpkin until close to Halloween, because no matter what you do with it, it will still taste like pumpkin. It’s not like berries or apples that you can do a thousand things with. As a pastry chef, ifI serve pumpkin too soon, people will get sick ofit — and ifI take it offthe menu, there is nothing to replace it with. So I try to wait so I don’t peak too early. Figs are great for fall. The problem with figs is that there are not that many fig lovers out there. There are a lot more peach, chocolate, and apple lovers than there are fig lovers. When I make a fig dessert, I’ll pair it with a raspberry or late summer fruit so it’s more likely to meet with customer acceptance. In the fall, I’ll make more cakes. Fall also turns into caramel season, and fall fruits work so well with caramel. I keep a lighter hand with caramel in the fall because it is being combined with fruit versus chocolate. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",CUISINE,,

BACON,Coment,"Bacon can be salt, fat, and/or smoke, depending on the bacon you choose. You can also play with its texture, depending on whether you are using pork belly or crispy bacon. It is wonderful with vegetables. The fat is delicious, so ifyou are braising onions in bacon fat, reduce that down, and add a little onionjus and vinegar, you have a great sauce. Bacon just brings another layer offlavor to the vegetables. My dish ofBerkshire pork chop with scarlet turnips, roasted rhubarb, and smoked bacon with cherry-almond salsa seca represents the relationship between fat, salt, sugar, and acid; they are all there. The bacon brings complexity to the pork; the cherry brings acid balance; and the almond brings a different kind offat with crunch. The almonds in the dish are marcona, and every tenth one is extremely bitter, which adds another layer ofcomplexity. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

"BASIL (See also Basil, Thai, and Lemon Basil)",Coment,"I use basil a lot. I will add it at the very end ofcooking a dish, and it will totally change where the dish is going. Added at the last second, it gives a minty freshness that was not there before. Basil says “fresh” and “alive” to me. And although you can get it year-round, I associate it with summer. I think particularly offish and shellfish with basil. I cook a lobster with a sauce ofsweet Muscat or Sauternes, curry, and lime. This is a dish that has been played with. The shells have been chopped up, added to mirepoix, and turned into sauce. Then there’s wine. So when the basil hits, you have this whole new thing going on. It opens up the dish and makes it light. It goes against the ""worked-on” aspect ofthe dish. In Thai cooking, you will find coconut milk-based curry that will have whole leaves ofbasil in it. Basil becomes something of a vegetable served this way. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
"BASIL (See also Basil, Thai, and Lemon Basil)",Coment,"I love basil in syrups. It works with strawberries and any citrus fruit. The trio I use the most for summer fruits like berries is basil, lemon, and vanilla. I have even macerated cherry tomatoes in this combination and made them into a fruit crisp. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
"BASIL (See also Basil, Thai, and Lemon Basil)",Coment,"I love basil. It is more familiar than cilantro, and more people like it. I use it in ceviche instead ofcilantro because it is not as pungent. I combine hamachi tuna with tomato, watermelon, yuzu, and sesame seeds with fresh basil and basil oil. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
"BASIL (See also Basil, Thai, and Lemon Basil)",Coment,"I use this in lots of vegetarian dishes because it gives them some oomph. It also works well with meat dishes, from beefto carpaccio to venison. I make a Thai basil pesto but make a few adjustments to the recipe or else it can look bruised and take on a funky color. We will add a little pumpkin seed oil to keep it a deep, rich green. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

BAY LEAF,Coment,"I am a little too fond of bay leaf. I use it a lot. I probably have a fondness for it because I associate it with so many childhood flavors, like pot roast. It has a hearty quality to it and I associate it with stocks and big flavors. I will use fresh or dried bay leaf. Fresh bay leaf has fresher flavor and is surprisingly more intense than dried bay leaf, but it’s still not as dramatic a difference as you can find with other herbs when it comes to fresh versus dried. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BAY LEAF,Coment,"Inexperienced cooks will throw a handful of bay leaves into 40 gallons ofveal stock. What happens next is they go to make a sauce and can’t figure out what to do about the medicinal taste. Its the bay leaf! 1’11 explain they only need two or three at the most. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)",,,

"BEANS, FAVA (aka Broad Beans or Horse Beans)",Coment,"Fava beans have a great flavor. Cooks in the past would blanch them, and the flavor would be left in the water. Today, what I like to do with favas and other vegetables is to put them in a pan with a little water, olive oil, or butter, and to cover them while they cook. That way, all the flavor stays in the vegetables. IfI could cook for my customers the way I like to cook and eat at home, I would sweat some spring onions in a pan with butter or oil, covered, to keep in the flavor. Then I’d add the shucked fava beans and let them cook with a little water. At the last second, I’d toss in some chopped parsley or basil, and there’s your sauce. This would be great under some fish. Ifyou added some thyme and maybe a little lambjus, it would also work with lamb. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
"BEANS, FAVA (aka Broad Beans or Horse Beans)",Coment,"Fava beans have a very delicate flavor, I like them raw and tender by themselves — or combined with sheep’s milk cheese and olive oil. However, I wouldn’t use an olive oil that’s too peppery or spicy, because it would overwhelm them. — TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

BEEF — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I love blue cheese with beef. We make a dish with blue cheese sauce that has chicken stock, Dijon mustard, truffle juice, and fresh truffle. This is a sauce that has many layers offlavor. The mustard is barely there but adds much more flavor to the sauce than vinegar or lemon would. The sauce is served on a [beef] filet that has been poached in spiced red wine. The poaching liquid is made with Cabernet Sauvignon that has been reduced for 25 minutes to concentrate its flavor, juniper berries, pepper, star anise, fennel seeds, and cloves. The cooked tannin in the wine really brings up the meaty flavor ofthe beef. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
BEEF — IN GENERAL,Coment,"All cuts of beef have a different flavor profile: There is the big beefy flavor ofthe strip steak, the luxurious tenderness offilet mignon, and the juicy, fatty mouthfeel of a great rib eye. Skirt steak is a juicy cut that is great served as an open-faced sandwich. Hanger steak has an offal quality to it and is different from all the others. Braised short ribs pick up all ofthe flavors ofwhat they are cooked with, developing layers of deep, dark beefflavor after being cooked on the bone for hours. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — IN GENERAL,Coment,"We make a wood-grilled 18-ounce “prime” rib eye of beefwith a gratin of macaroni and goat cheese, glazed shallots, oxtail red wine sauce, and Jleur de sei. This dish is meat on meat on meat! We have the steak, oxtail sauce, and shallots braised in veal stock. This dish has so much flavor. You have the richness and fattiness ofthe rib eye, and we grill it over a wood fire that takes it to a whole other place. Top it with a drizzle ofolive oil, theJleur de sei, cracked pepper, and then add rich oxtail sauce to it. People go crazy for it. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)",,,

BEEF — BRISKET,Coment,"You can braise brisket for hours, and it still tastes like brisket, making it ideal to prepare for large parties. Nothing is better than what the Texans do with brisket, and that is barbecue. I also noticed that Texans get the fattiest brisket I have ever seen, so the fat just melts away and the meat is self-basting. My favorite barbecued brisket is from Mueller’s outside ofAustin. He cooks it about twenty hours and then wraps it in brown butcher paper to let it rest — which I think is the key to his barbecue. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

BEEF — SHORT LOIN,Coment,"This is the T-bone steak. When it is cut double cut [that is, twice as thick], that is when it is a porterhouse. The story goes that it was first served in Lower Manhattan in 1815 at a porter house. The owner ran out ofhis usual cut ofmeat, and when a customer asked for something to go with his porter [beer], the owner cut him this huge piece of meat. It became known as a “porterhouse” steak. The porterhouse steak is part filet mignon and part strip steak. It is the perfect grilling steak. You get the tenderness ofthe filet, and the big beefy chewiness of the strip steak. — MICHAEL LOMONACO. PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

BEEF — SHORT RIBS,Coment,Vikram Vij of Vancouver's Vij's on Beef Short Ribs in Cinnamon,,,
BEEF — SHORT RIBS,Coment,"For braising, I prefer to use cinnamon bark. Cinnamon stick is pretty, but it is steamed and rolled and a little too manipulated. In this dish, cinnamon bark is big and intense and not needed for presentation. At the end of the braise, you pull it out and throw it away. This dish is cooked for four hours and the cinnamon flavor does not cook out. In the end, the cinnamon imparts a delicate, sweet, aromatic flavor. It adds contrast to the chile flavor from the curry. If this dish ever has too much cinnamon flavor, you can counterbalance it with rice or yogurt that has a little salt and pepper in it. — VIKRAM VIJ. VIJ'S (VANCOUVER)",,,

BEEF — SHORT RIBS,Coment,"Short ribs are a luxurious cut ofmeat, because they are braised for three to three and a half hours. We don’t braise our ribs in red wine, but in Yuengling Porter, which has ethereal chocolate notes in the aroma. In the sauce with the beer is mirepoix, a sachet of herbs, lots ofpeppercorns, and chiles. 1 went to a charity event where they served short ribs for six hundred guests, and one reason it worked is because it is a cut that allows for a great margin of error. You cook it until it is well done and falling-off-the-bone tender. Falling-ofFthe-bone tender is one ofthe appeals of a braised dish. It is sensual. Get yourself a glass of good spicy Syrah with that short rib dish and think great thoughts! — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

A hanger steak is incredibly flavorful. There is only one per carcass, and it comes from the area close to the kidneys, so it has almost an offal flavor to the beef. It has become popular because it is different and not a typical-tasting steak. I like a hanger steak grilled and served rare to medium rare. Slicing is also important, because you have to cut it on the bias so that it is tender. I like a hanger steak served with a traditional sauce, such as a caramelized shallot and red wine sauce or a bourbon peppercorn sauce. It is important to caramelize the shallots so they get sweet and offset the gaminess ofthe steak. I use bourbon instead of cognac because it has more punch to it, and I’ll use four different peppercorns — white, black, pink, and green — with the last two modulating the flavor. Green peppercorns have the sharpness to cut through the richness. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

It is very reasonably priced as well. It is very popular in the Latin community, especially with Argentinians. You often see it flattened with a mallet to tenderize it [by breaking the meat fibers] and used in fajitas. This, along with the hanger steak, is the beefiest flavored cut ofbeef. We serve it in a chimichurri sauce, which is a classic Argentinian sauce made ofchopped garlic, onion, and parsley, plus white [we use champagne] vinegar, red pepper flakes, and a little olive oil. It grills really well. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,Coment,"Rib steak is the most popular cut next to filet mignon. The cut comes from the rib roast, where one end meets the chuck at the fattier end and the other meets the short loin at the leaner end. The rib steak that meets the chuck end is the most popular and can even have a big knot offat in it. This is one of my favorite steaks. A big, fatty, juicy rib steak can’t be beat on the grill. I cook these bone-on because it gives more beefflavor. We do a Brandt Ranch cut that comes from California just north of Mexico. That area has lots offlavor influences, so I choose to do a chili rub on the steak. The cut is Holstein, which has a sweeter edge to its meat. We grill it so that fat melts away and bastes it as it cooks. At the end, we brush it with a blend ofancho chili, light brown sugar, toasted ground cumin seeds, chipotle chile, and a pinch of cayenne. Then we char it one more time, so that is like reseasoning the meat. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,Coment,"The sirloin is a good, beefy-flavored high-quality cut. It is a cut toward the back ofthe animal that gets more work, so it is a little chewy, but it is a good-quality steak for barbecuing. Ifthis cut is quickly cooked over high heat on a grill, not overcooked, and sliced correctly on the bias, you are going to get the most out ofit. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,RECIPE,Michael Lomonaco of Porter House New York on Cooking Steak,,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,RECIPE,"Aging: Aging is important because it tenderizes the steak. The aging process breaks down the fibers and dehydrates the steak, concentrating its flavor. A dryaged steak has a more minerally and sharp edge to it, versus fresh meat that tastes sweeter. It is critical to the flavor and adds to the cost because it takes four weeks of aging to achieve it.",,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,RECIPE,"Seasoning: All our steaks are seasoned with coarse kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper just prior to cooking, which draws out the flavor while they cook. A squeeze of lemon makes a good Tuscan steak taste even better. If you are in Italy and eating ""bistecca Fiorentina,"" what you are having is an Italian porterhouse. The steak is grilled over dried grape vines and served with a drizzle of green olive oil from the first pressing of the new harvest and lemons on the side.",,Citrus,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,RECIPE,"Cooking: A steak should be cooked rare to medium rare. ""Rare"" is a little cool inside and hot on the exterior. ""Medium rare"" is just a shade past, and only warm in the middle. Cooking a steak beyond that point, it starts to toughen up and the fat oozes out, making it increasingly dry and tough.",,,
BEEF — STEAK: SKIRT,RECIPE,"Saucing: Part of looking forward is looking back. Sauces provide the connection to historical French and Italian cooking. In the gastronomic world, the saucier was the top cook in the kitchen. It is all about building layer upon layer of complexity in a sauce. It is most often sweet and sour, to cut through the richness of the fat of the steak. Red wine sauce has the acidity to cut richness, with sweetness from caramelized shallots, and it enhances the beef flavor. We also make a homemade barbecue sauce as our steak sauce, which is sweet from light brown sugar and molasses, tart from red wine vinegar, and smoky from chipotle peppers.",,,
BEEF — STEAK TARTARE,Coment,"We make tartare from filet mignon and hand-chop it to order, which I like so that I don’t feel like I’m just eating ground beef. I season our tartare with mustard, capers, and anchovies, which I am not shy about. You want the texture ofthe beefto be a counterpoint. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — STEAK TARTARE,Coment,"When you see rare roast beef, it is top round. It is a little tough, and that is why you see roast beef always sliced so thin. Nothing beats top round for a good old-fashioned roast beefsandwich because it doesn’t have any gristle or fat — just good, beefy flavor. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEEF — STEAK TARTARE,Coment,"When I was in Ireland, I swilled Guinness [stout] and ate bangers and mash, which was essentially sausage with caramelized onions on top. It was so good that when I came back to the U.S., I started experimenting with Guinness. That’s how I came up with a dish of braised short ribs that had been marinated in Guinness. The problem you often have cooking with beer is that sometimes the dish gets bitter. So, to counteract that naturally without using sugar, 1 choose to use onions. I marinate the ribs in the beer, then braise them, and finish the dish with a puree ofroasted onions for balance. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

BEETS,Coment,"Beets are especially delicious when accented by a salty cheese, whether queso fresco or ricotta salata. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,,
BEETS,Coment,"People love fresh beets. Now I won’t lay claim to inventing beet salad with Gorgonzola and hazelnuts, but how our version is different from many others is that we marinate the beets. Overnight, we’ll marinate peeled beets in Barolo vinegar, shallots, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Using Russian and Polish cooking principles, marinating the beets ensures that the vinegar is able to penetrate them so that they are sure to be tangy. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
BEETS,Coment,"I wanted to take beets that are associated with winter and make them into something summery, so I used them for a ceviche. We roasted and pureed them with lime and froze them into a sorbet. We served the beet sorbet flat in a bowl so it looked like soup. From there, we layered thinly sliced raw bay scallops with segments oflime, cilantro, and red onion oil. The dish is very fresh tasting. The other key to this dish was that we had all the flavors ofceviche but did not marinate the scallops in the acid, which makes them rubbery. The scallops treated this way are more delicate, like sushi. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,

BEETS,Explanation,"We serve a salad that showcases the classic combination of beets, walnuts, and orange. We boil our beets, then slice them thinly on the plate. We add frisee to the salad and, since it is bitter, we mix in Cambozola cheese and candied walnuts. We dress the salad with a sherry-walnut-tarragon vinaigrette, and a mandarin orange sauce. People are surprised when they eat the dish — first, because they find out they like beets, and second, because the frisee is not bitter after being softened by the sweet touches. — MONICA POPE, T'AFIA (HOUSTON)",,Citrus,ORANGE

That’s why I serve cress or watercress with a steak and potato dish, and arugula with our seared bluefin tuna on braised veal cheeks, and a bed of bitter greens like watercress, frisee, arugula, and shaved endive as the base for our foie gras dish — to cut the richness. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,,

BRUNCH,Explanation,"BRUNCH Customers are picky at brunch. They have all cooked what they think they like, they think they can do it slightly better than we can, and they want it twice as fast. So, we take the classics like pancakes or French toast, use them as building blocks, and push them a little further. We will offer seasonal pancakes. In the winter, we’ll make buckwheat pancakes with cinnamon and glazed oranges. Bridging spring into summer, we’ll offer corn and saffron pancakes with a spicy poached pear and fresh ricotta. Saffron and corn work really well together because ofthe floral nature ofthe saffron and sweetness ofthe corn. We will use poached pears on the pancakes until switching to blueberries for the summer, which give a real pop. The pears are poached in a red wine syrup with aleppo chile that is a sundried chile with a rich, round, sweet spice to it. The chile is not noticeable, but it acts like an acid by lightening, plus cutting the sugar and richness of, the pancake. When people eat pancakes, they naturally reach for butter. I don’t serve butter with my pancakes and instead serve fresh ricotta. We use ricotta from Anne Saxelby, who supplies us with a fresh, rich, velvety ricotta, and this gives a richness to the dish. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,ORANGE

"BUTTER, BROWN (aka Beurre Noisette)",Coment,"One ofmy favorite flavors in the world is brown butter. Afinancier cake made with brown butter is one ofthe best things ever. I have been making a brown butter vinaigrette for a jillion years! It is a super-easy pan sauce that 1 love as a warm sauce: I just brown my butter in a pan until it gets the noisette [brown] color, then add some balsamic vinegar. It doesn't even need to be expensive balsamic. You make an emulsification in the pan, and add a little salt and pepper and it’s done. The flavor ofbrown butter, salt, and acid is one ofmy favorites. It works well on different fish like scallops or halibut or soft-shell crabs. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
"BUTTER, BROWN (aka Beurre Noisette)",Coment,"Brown butter is one ofmy favorite flavors, and it pairs well with anything nutty, as well as richer fruits like bananas. A classic French financieris hands-down one ofmy favorite French pastries [a cookie made with brown butter, egg whites, flour, and powdered sugar|. Butter tastes great on its own, and in making brown butter you are not adding anything to it — just transforming it, so that it becomes more. The process is simple but a little tricky, as it keeps cooking even after it is offthe stove. Something you can do to improve it is — halfway through the cooking process — start whisking the butter, because it intensifies the flavor ifyou keep the particles suspended. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

CABBAGE — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Cabbage often has the connotation ofbeing heavy, but in the fall, we’ll make a fine chiffonade of cabbage thats very light. I like to cut cabbage thin and roast it in a pan so that the edges just get brown because that tastes really good. We figured that out by mistake by putting cabbage into too hot a pan. After the chefraised his voice about how that is the wrong way to cook cabbage, we tasted it, and it was good! We now serve a green cabbage dish cooked this way with caraway seeds and walnuts, then deglazed with Calvados. We also add a little cider vinegar and olive oil to finish. It is a nice, easy marriage. It is not an unpredictable marriage; these things just all work together. We pair this with braised pork belly, but it would also work with a roasted breast ofsquab with its leg done in a confit. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

CARROTS,Coment,"Thumbelina carrots are something I missed when I moved from working in the country [i.e., Pocantico Hills, New York, where Blue Hill at Stone Barns is located] into Manhattan. Luckily, I recently found these short, fat carrots at the green market. We saute these carrots over an open fire so that they get a little smoky. When they are cooked, they become soft and creamy. Once cooked, we turn them into a puree with a shot ofcarrot juice at the last second. We pair this with farro that has been cooked like risotto, then add some pine nuts and more Thumbelina carrots that have been quartered. I don’t know what is more seductive: the smooth carrot farro with its light carrot flavor or the carrots themselves that are totally creamy. The dish has no butter or cream but that is not because we are trying to be healthy. The dish just doesn’t need it. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CARROTS,Coment,"Juices are a great way to freshen up a dish. Ifyou cook a carrot, you lose the “carrotiness” ofit. Ifyou make a carrot soup with cooked carrots, it doesn’t become bright. So now we do a carrot base with cooked organic carrots with tops, onions, garlic, and maybe some ginger and lemongrass. With that base we make a really thick soup and then add carrot juice to it. In the end you have fresh and cooked carrots for a better flavor profile. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
CARROTS,Coment,"I had a salad at a restaurant with grated carrots and tarragon leaves with pistachios — and I knew the minute I tasted it that I could adapt this salad to be my own. Instead of grating the carrots, I cut them on the bias and roasted them with a little ginger andjuca [an African mix made of almonds, pistachios, hazelnuts, and spices]. To finish the salad, I added the whole tarragon leaves, great pistachio oil, and a raita ofyogurt and golden raisins. The dish has wonderful colors and texture and those beautiful whole leaves oftarragon which I had never thought to do myself. — MONICA POPE, T'AFIA (HOUSTON)",,,
CARROTS,Coment,"Carrots — which pair well with allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and cumin — are one ofthe few vegetables that shine in desserts. When I first came to the U.S. I discovered carrot cake and that you could use carrots for dessert. I have since made carrot ice cream, cookies, and fruit paste. The problem is that most people trust carrot cake but little else. When I am using carrots for dessert, I like to cook them with orange. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,ORANGE

The combination, however, runs a lot deeper than that. The amine [organic chemical compounds] levels in caviar and white chocolate are such that the two ingredients almost ""melt” together. — HESTON BLUMENTHAL, THE FAT DUCK (ENGLAND)",,,

CELERY,Coment,"Using a pinch ofcayenne is like having a turbo versus a regular engine in your car. The cayenne goes into you so fast it islike creating an engine for your flavors. It will create a certain heat and speedy access to your flavors. I use cayenne in everything. However, it has to be done carefully. It has to be just a pinch at the last minute. Ifyou are using basil, it will make the flavor even stronger. — ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CELERY,Coment,"Ofall vegetables, celery has one ofthe strongest flavors. To me, it is almost like a truffle. In a mirepoix, you need all the vegetables — but if I could have only one, it would be celery'. I love its earthy flavor. Celery and black truffles are my favorite combination. They work in part because they come out ofthe ground at the same time ofyear. Any root vegetable also works with celery. I enjoy celery root and celery separately as well as together. — DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY",,,

CHEESE — IN GENERAL (See also specific cheeses),Coment,"Since cheese is a near-perfect food, I sometimes look for the few nutrients missing in cheese that can be found in other foods. The two essential nutrients that cheese does not provide are vitamin C and fiber. This recommends fruits especially — and makes a great start to the day: cheese, some high-fiber vitamin C-rich fruit, some whole grain organic bread, and coffee. The breads 1 prefer with cheese are usually neutral flavored, though I fully appreciate the nutty or herbed or fruity breads as natural partners for cheeses. The main reason I prefer neutral flavors in my breads is because 1 don’t want to meddle with the flavors in the cheeses themselves. I’m kind of a purist on that! Usually, the softer the cheese, the harder the bread — to an extent. And high-pectin, high-fiber fruits [e.g., apples, pears, apricots, plums, nectarines, peaches, figs] make natural accompaniments for many, many cheeses. Which cheeses? My faves with my espresso to which I add a little unfiltered raw honey would be the pressed sheep milk cheeses: Ossau Iraty, Roncal, Zamorano, Berkswell, Spenwood, Trade Lake Cedar, Vermont Shepherd, manchego, or Pecorino Foglie Noce. But I’m happy with whatever is looking good, and preferably the harder aged cheeses: sheep, goat, or cow. — MAX McCALMAN, ARTISANAL CHEESE CENTER (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHEESE — IN GENERAL (See also specific cheeses),Coment,"With aged or strong cheese, you need something fruity or sweet to contrast with the strong flavor. Pecorino is very strong, so you need something sweet with it. With an aged or hard cheese, I like to serve some chestnut honey, a fruit jam, or watermelon confiture. If I have some aged goat cheese, I like a mostarda [Italian mustard fruit]. With sharper cheese, I also like a nice sweet wine, especially an Italian Passito. With fresh young cheese, I simply like some good bread. Chestnut honey, while good with aged cheese, does not work with a young cheese. — ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHEESE — IN GENERAL (See also specific cheeses),Coment,"Honey, jam, and mostarda go great with cheese. Most honey works best with younger cheeses and soft-ripened cheeses, especially ifthey have a chalky quality to them. I love mountain Gorgonzola with chestnut honey, it is crazy! In Italy, we call jam a confitura or marmalata. I like it with saltier cheeseslike Parmesan, or with more assertive cheeses. Mostarda is made offruits cooked in a white wine mustard syrup until they are candied. So, you have a sweet candy effect with the spicy mustard. It goes with any savory firm cheese, and particularly well with pecorino and Taleggio. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

"CHEESE, RICOTTA",Coment,"Cina DePalma of New York's Babbo on Babbo's Cheese Plate

At Babbo, I oversee the cheese selection,
which has seven choices. The biggest challenge with Italian cheese is that there are
so many “superstars"" that you just can’t
not offer them. So, in the seven slots we
have many standard choices but they are
amazing:

• Parmigiano-Reggiano: This is the
’’undisputed king of all cheeses""
according to Mario [Batali] I
• Taleggio: This washed-rind cheese is
very wet, has the distinctive orange color,
and is gooey. The interior is sweet and the
rind is assertive.
• Gorgonzola Piccante: This is firmer,
bluer, nutty, and just amazing!
• Coach Farm Goat: Though it is not
from Italy, it is the goat cheese we
choose. [Mario Batali’s wife's family owns
the Coach Farm Dairy.]
• Robiola: This is a soft-ripened cheese
from Piedmont.
• Pecorino: This is a sheep's milk cheese
that is nothing like the Pecorino-Romano
that you get in your deli to grate over
pasta. This is made in many areas around
Italy. We may use one from the south or
Tuscany or one that is rubbed with
tomato or aged underground from
another part of the country.
• The Seventh Cheese: I play around
with the seventh cheese and change it
often but a recent favorite is a Piave,
which is like an English Cheddar. It is from
the Veneto along the Piave River.",,Citrus,ORANGE

CHERRIES — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Cherries can stand up to a lot offlavors. They have more juice to them as well as complexity. Almonds go with cherries. Dark chocolate actually goes better with cherries than it does raspberries, and white chocolate works with cherries as well. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
CHERRIES — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Ifyou have perfect ingredients in the summertime, you don’t have to do much to them. With our perfect cherries [Michigan, while at Tribute restaurant], we halved them, sprinkled them with sugar, and heated them with a blowtorch so that they were just warmed through. The slightly caramelized sugar made a huge difference in the flavor. I used a goat cream cheese worked to a texture similar to mascarpone cheese, which I shaped into quenelles. Served alongside were some ice wine vinegar caramel sauce and a crispy crepe. Before serving, I added individual thyme leaves and a crack of black pepper. These are all really classic flavors, especially the cheese with black pepper and cherries. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHERRIES — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I was reading an old Fannie Farmer cookbook from the late 1800s about making cherry jam. In the recipe, they would take the cherry pits and crush them. I thought it was crazy but tried it. When you take cherry pits and crush them, it gives you an almond flavor. I made some pickled sour cherries with the crushed pits in cheesecloth with the pickling liquid and I got this great almondy flavor that went deep inside the cherries. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHERRIES — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I like to let them shine on their own. But I do really like cherries and
grappa. Mario [Batali] has a home in Michigan and he brought me
back a case ofcherries. They were so perfect I just macerated them in
grappa and torn mint leaves. I served them in a bowl with a dollop of
mascarpone. Cherries also work well with mint.
— GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHERRIES — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I loved cherries so much growing up that I would climb up our cherry tree and eat as many as I could. Then I would realize I didn’t know how to get back down and would cry until the neighbors would get me down. I still love cherries and especially in cherry pie or a clafoutis. Cherries work well with vanilla or poached in red wine, but I like to keep them as simple as possible. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

CHICKEN,Coment,"Red beans and rice with andouille sausage is my favorite! When we opened up after the hurricane [Katrina] and were serving on paper plates, I made a roasted Tabasco chicken served with dirty rice, with the sausage stuffed in a bell pepper alongside red bean puree. For another dish, I was inspired by a diner down the street from us that had chicken and waffles on the menu, which is an old Southern dish. My take is to make a savory waffle and to add Boursin cheese with lots of herbs. Then I pair it with chicken thighs braised in a coq au vin blanc and serve it with spinach. The dish is simple, but I just love the flavors. — BOB IACOVONE. CUV^E (NEW ORLEANS)",,,

1. Brining: Sometimes the older techniques inspire me for deeper flavors. Many of these techniques are overlooked. Take brining, for instance. Brining has been done forever with pork chops and chicken, and for the last five years you have heard about it with turkey. The success of brining is more about the salt and it getting in there and softening the protein strands. It is less about all the other flavoring agents.
If you want to get started in your kitchen, start with a skin- and bone-on chicken breast. Grab some kosher salt, sugar, or honey as I do, some water, and brine the breast for 30 minutes.
When you pull it out of the brine, rinse it. dry it, and let it sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours so the moisture comes out. You will notice the difference in the texture. The marinated chicken — even if you overcook it — will not be dry. It is the best.
2. Marinating: The chicken on my menu right now is brined and then marinated for 24 hours. It is crazy how good the chicken becomes. 
The marinade is made up of roasted garlic, Sicilian oregano, red pepper flakes, lots of lemon, thyme, and olive oil. We joke that it tastes like Zesty Italian Wish-Bone Dressing. It is so delicious.
The finished dish is served with poached and sauteed artichoke, roasted pepper grilled over wood, fennel, and roasted spring onions. These vegetables are all tossed with pesto, and the dish is finished with a tomato sauce made with foamy tomato water and thyme

Chicken Cacciatore
We opened up A Voce with chicken cacciatore on our menu and when people heard the name of the dish, they'd just yawn. A lot of times, this dish is just chicken scaloppine with peppers and tomatoes. Ours is a whole different dish: the chicken is on the bone, and brined first, which makes it nice and moist. With it, we serve a homemade peperonata with roasted peppers, onions, garlic, red pepper flakes, rosemary, fresh bay leaf, fresh thyme, and piment d'Espelette [a pepper from France with a smoky flavor]. Here is a place where technique plays a role in the flavor: When you roast peppers, the best way to get the skin off is to put them in a bowl covered with plastic wrap and let them steam. When they are done, you are left with the pepper liquid. What we do is cook with that liquid.
To finish this dish, we put a big scoop of the pepper mixture, tomato sauce, garlic
puree, onion, red wine vinegar, and fresh bay leaf on the chicken and put it in the oven to roast. The chicken cooks in its own juice then is served with roasted potatoes. It is delicious What we are doing is layering the flavors. You have the technique of brining the chicken, elevating the flavor profile of the peppers with the sweetness of the onions and
herbs, adding a little heat from the piment d'Espelette, and giving body to the sauce from the pepperjuice, which is distilled pepper brandy.",,Citrus,BRANDY

CHINESE CUISINE (See also Szechuan Cuisine),Coment,"In Chinese cooking they have a technique called “red cooking” that is a dish braised or steamed with star anise, dark soy sauce, cinnamon, and rock sugar. I cook the oxtail for my timbale of oxtail and foie gras that way, and then clarify the broth and turn it into the aspic that holds the dish together. The foie gras is cooked separately and made into a terrine. The dish is then served with gingery pickled vegetables. It is not a Chinese dish in that it is not a dish that you would find in a Chinese restaurant, but it has Chinese influences. The idea of clarifying the broth is typically French. The use offoie gras is not very Chinese. The pickled vegetables are like something you might find in Chinese cooking, but they are done in perfect dice and served as a relish. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,

CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"My chocolate-corn dessert [ofsoft chocolate ganache and sweet com in three textures: crunchy corn and hazelnut corn sorbet, and com tuile] was inspired by freeze-dried corn. [The kernels] are whole with a vibrant sweetness. Corn dates back to the Aztecs, who also loved chocolate, so it’s funny when people ask, “Where’d you get the inspiration?” This starts with a layer of milk chocolate hazelnut praline paste, then the corn, and then crushed wafers that give it that Kit Kat candy bar texture; on top ofthat is some chocolate ganache, then a layer ofchocolate. To play off those flavors I serve some espelette [pepper] to give a little heat and some smoked salt from Wales. This dish is about the interplay ofthe chocolate and the corn. The espelette gives a heat that reminds me ofroasted com salsa. This is an ode to the origin ofthe inspiration. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"It is hard to think ofa fruit or nut that is not improved by combining it with chocolate. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"I love chocolate with fruit or nuts or both. My favorite candy bar in the world is a Cadbury Fruit and Nut bar. On my menu I have a chocolate, hazelnut, and orange dessert, which is essentially a Cadbury! — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,ORANGE
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"When it comes to chocolate, keep it simple. That’s always good advice! For simplicity at its best, only two ingredients are necessary: heavy cream and chopped chocolate. Bring the cream to a boil, pour it over the chocolate, and it turns into ganache. Serve it warm with just a spoon. How can you do any better? In my new book, I feature a recipe called Cup O’ Dark Chocolate, and essentially it is ganache poured into a cup. Then you grab a cookie, and have at it! Ifyou want to dip fruit into chocolate, dried fruits such as figs, pear, and pineapple all work really well. People always ask what they can serve to impress their sweetheart on Valentine’s Day, and fresh strawberries are really nice in February. Just make a warm ganache, grab the strawberries, and start dipping. Fresh grapes are fantastic with chocolate. Dip them into the melted chocolate, pop them in the freezer, and when they are frozen, put them into a two-quart container. That way, you will always have a little treat in the freezer. Be careful though — they are not M&Ms, so they will melt in your hands! — MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"Everybody is on the chocolate bandwagon now, and we are not far away from the proverbial “man on the street’ knowing the difference between a 72 percent and a 66 percent chocolate. The boutique chocolate makers are now coming up with estate and varietal and vintage chocolates. I love that, but honestly, once you add enough sugar and cream to chocolate, those nuances are all gone. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"People always ask why I use bittersweet versus semisweet chocolate. Semisweet is chocolate that needs salt. When you add salt to it, it brings up the bitter flavor and makes it taste bittersweet. Semisweet chocolate to me tastes kind offlat. Milk chocolate can taste flat as well. Now that there is Scharffen Berger and El Rey on the market, I find both those chocolates to be really, really great, with both flavor and kick to them. But ifyou want a killer chocolate dessert, don’t use milk chocolate. When I write a dessert menu, there will be a couple of chocolate desserts, with one being a killer chocolate and the other a lighter option, like chocolate with bananas. Ifyou don’t have something intensely chocolate, chocolate lovers are very, very unhappy. Banana souffle with chocolate is not considered a chocolate dessert. You have to be careful with a killer chocolate dessert — you can’t just put chocolate, chocolate, and chocolate together. There has to be balance so the dessert is not too rich. To achieve balance, turn to coffee or caramel because they pair so well and help to intensify the chocolate flavor. For some desserts, I like to combine white and dark chocolate, or milk and dark chocolate, to give balance and cut intensity. It sounds crazy, but you can use one chocolate to mellow the flavor of another. I’m not a fan of herbs with dessert, with the possible exception of chocolate. I love the combination ofchocolate with mint. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"I don’t have a big sweet tooth but I do like all kinds of chocolate, from dark to white. Each one is completely different. I like the bitterness and clean flavor of dark chocolate. I like milk chocolate with a piece ofbread like when I was a kid. You have to select your white chocolate carefully because not all ofit is good. White chocolate works well in a mousse; it has a more neutral flavor and does not dictate. Dark chocolate is all about being the star, versus white, that is better to play with. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
CHOCOLATE / COCOA — IN GENERAL,Flavor Affinities,"Dark chocolate goes really well with coffee or caramel, but ifI could only pick one it would be the caramel! Caramel and chocolate play so well together despite both being strong flavors. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

"CHOCOLATE, WHITE",Coment,"I make a cake with dark cocoa, which makes for a bitter chocolate flavor, and then in the middle a milk chocolate cream. Many people don’t realize how great the chocolate flavor of cocoa is. It adds bitterness and intensity without adding richness. That is invaluable because so many chocolate desserts are so rich. Often when I make a chocolate ice cream, I will combine melted chocolate and cocoa. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
"CHOCOLATE, WHITE",Coment,"My dessert of milk chocolate pot de creme, caramel foam, maple syrup, and Maldon sea salt served in an emptied-out eggshell symbolizes that a few ingredients can come together in a way that is greater than the sum oftheir parts. The key ingredient which ties it together is the Maldon sea salt. This combination elevates all the ingredients. Starting with chocolate, caramel was the logical next step. At the time, I played withJleur de sei, red salt from Hawaii, and others, before ending up with the Maldon. I like the concept of using sugar as a seasoning, beyond its natural necessity in dessert. I also like natural sweetness from things and maple sugar brings a lot offlavor beyond sweetness. Once I hit upon this combination, I have never changed it. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
"CHOCOLATE, WHITE",Coment,"Valrhona and El Rey are both good. When you are looking for a white chocolate, you want one that has some smoothness to it. It is not going to have the acidity that dark chocolate has. When you are making a dessert with white chocolate, it is going to be a softer, smoother dessert. I don’t like dark chocolate and raspberries together, but I believe I am one ofthe few chefs who feel this way. What I don’t like is that when you take a bite ofthe chocolate with the berry, the acidity of the two don’t blend. The acids are too similar, so it doesn’t feel like a single dessert in your mouth. Instead, it is a clash with both ofthem bouncing into each other in your mouth. They don’t bridge, and even whipped cream doesn’t bring them together. But ifyou use white chocolate, its softness works much better with berries. The white chocolate complements the berries and brings out their flavors. Citrus, especially anything in the orange family, also works well with white chocolate. Nuts, such as almonds, work well with white chocolate. Spices also work well with white chocolate. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,ORANGE

CHORIZO (See also Sausages),Coment,"After a visit to Spain. I created a chorizo broth to go with monkfish. I love chorizo, with its paprika flavors and the fattiness ofthe pork. So I had to figure out how to make a sauce out ofa dried piece ofsausage. We melted the chorizo in a pan for a long time, and ended up with a flavorful grease that was not that appealing. However, we emulsified it in an herb-infused clam broth, and it became velvety. It wasn’t greasy, and gave the sauce a little kick. I chose this sauce to go with monkfish because it is a meaty fish and can stand up to spice and to strong flavors really well. Chorizo would not destroy the soul ofthe fish. — ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

COCONUT AND COCONUT MILK,Coment,"My coconut rice pudding strudel was the result ofTakashi’s influence. [Takashi Yagihashi was his chef at Detroit's Tribute restaurant.] Dessert has to make sense in the context ofthe rest ofthe meal. Being a pastry chefis exciting because you have a lot of autonomy, but you are still working within the chef’s framework. Takashi’s food was very Asian-influenced. This dish was meant to bring in Asian ingredients in a new way yet be something familiar. So we have rice pudding flavored with coconut, lemongrass, ginger, and vanilla, and diced apricot for texture. At the time I was introduced tofrie de brique, which is a Moroccan dough that is like a cross between phyllo and a wonton wrapper. I would wrap these ingredients in this dough and then saute them in clarified butter and slice them like a spring roll. Alongside I served green tea ice cream. This covered a lot ofbases for me: the warm and cold temperatures, the Asian influence, and doing something with boring old rice pudding. The coolest compliment I ever got was from Andrew Carmellini [chefofNew Yorks A Voce] who was sitting down with us and asked about my background. When I said I used to be a line cook, he said, ""I knew it — a pastry chefwould never come up with that!” It was the combination oftechniques and flavors as well as sauteing something to order. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,

CORN,Coment,"We participate in an event called “Plate and Pitchfork” that is held on a farm with the food from the farm. The guests sit in the field among the com and tomatoes, and we cook a meal for them on a couple of grills. I made a com soup for this event. We removed the husks, then cut the kernels offtire cob. Then we used the husks, which produce a juice, to make a stock for the soup. Ifyou were to use cobs, you wouldn’t get the same flavor. It is important to keep the corn flavor pure. Most cooks would throw in a bunch ofvegetables in the stock, and what you’d get then is a vegetable stock with corn. I want to have a corny flavor in the end. We made a stock using the corn husks cooked with a little onion, water, and salt, and let it cook for about 45 minutes. What came out was the most amazing sweet broth. We added the corn, pureed it, and served it chilled. It was so sweet and full ofcorn flavor you would have sworn there were cream and sugar in it. We now make a corn husk broth to add to a corn, chanterelle, and Dungeness crab risotto with a touch of pesto. Basil pesto and corn really speaks to me. It is a wonderful combination. — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)",,,
CORN,Coment,"To intensify the flavor ofcom in a dish, add [corn] juice. I’ll make a com ravioli with pureed corn and cooked corn. I add corn juice to the filling to add a fresh corn flavor to the ravioli. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

When it is caught atsea, it is cooked on the boat with heavily salted water. The first thing I did was soak the crab multiple times in ice water to draw out all the salt. I saw and created a vision ofthis red crabmeat within a barigoule with perfectly cut vegetables, artichokes, French green beans, Valencia oranges, sweet garlic, and finished with olive oil. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)",,Citrus,ORANGE

CREAM,Coment,"When you eat a piece of pumpkin pie, the whipped cream is the first thing you go for! You can take this for granted in desserts, or you can dig deeper You can think ofcream as its own flavor. When I was in Japan, the cream was miles better than here in the U.S. You also need to think about your dairy choice in relation to the country. In India, everything is centered around reduced milk. The counterpart would be dolce de leche in Latin cuisine. I love yogurt because it is simple and complex; it can be in the forefront or in the background. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY",,,

We soak the bread until it is saturated in milk, then let it sit [in the refrigerator] overnight. The next morning before serving, we coat it in egg and then fry it. We serve our version oftorrijas with poached apples and instead ofserving it with maple syrup, we serve it with Pedro Ximenez [a rich, sweet, Spanish sherry] syrup that has a raisin-like quality to it. The PX is just warmed and has a little glucose added to thicken it into a syrup. I don’t cook it or reduce it because I want to keep the alcohol in the syrup so it doesn’t become overly cloying. — ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TfA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",SPICE,,

DATES,Coment,"Someone told me about a savory date dish they had but could only remember that it was stuffed and wrapped in bacon. This led me into the kitchen to stuff a date with chorizo, wrap it in bacon, and then add charmoula [typically made ofpaprika, cayenne pepper, cumin, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, cilantro, and olive oil]. The dish just hits the mark. I also serve a sweet date dish that I stole from Judy Rodgers of Zuni Cafe. My version is made with Medjool dates that have maple mascarpone smeared in, pistachios crumbled on top, and orange blossom water. The orange blossom water gives people a visceral reaction because you don’t see it, but you taste it.

DATES,RECIPE,"Emily Luchetti of Farallon in San Francisco on When and How to Serve Dessert

The older I get, the more I like my dessert at 3:00 in the afternoon. I like it all by itself, it has no competition and you are usually hungry. Your taste buds are wide awake and you can appreciate what it
is. Of course if we have people over for dinner I can’t get away with not serving dessert!
When you serve a dessert after a meal you are already full, not in a bad way, but
if you had a first course and main course your palate has gone through many flavor components. At home I always take a little break and give people a breather between dinner and dessert. I'll have my guests help with the dishes or, if it's a formal party. I'll let them talk for a half hour and finish off the red wine. It is not just for their stomachs but for the palate as well.
I hate when it comes to slicing a dessert and someone says, ""No, no, that is too big!"" I used to fight it and take it personally, so now I just ask in advance. The guest appreciates it, has a small piece, and
then has seconds. It is recognizing that everyone has their own choice regarding how much they want to eat. If I am serving a shortcake, I will put the fruit with a little cream on the cake, then pass a bowl
of whipped cream, so whether they want to pile it or keep it light, they can.",,,

DUCK,Coment,"We serve a sixteen-ounce duck breast with a Pinot Noir, blackberry, and ginger sauce. The sauce is made from frozen Oregon blackberries, which I am not shy to admit I use, because eleven months out ofthe year, there is nothing better. At home, I make a version ofthis sauce with currant preserves: I saute the duck, then add lots offresh ginger and shallots, a few tablespoons of currant preserves, and some champagne vinegar to cut the sweetness. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, CHEF, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",MEAT,,
DUCK,Coment,"Our paella made with duck confit, foie gras, and morels is in honor of [tire late chef] Jean-Louis Palladin. We made a paella with the fat from the duck and morels, and to finish it we topped it with thin slices of raw foie gras. The foie gras would get warm from the hot rice and melt into the rice. It is an amazing paella! — JOSE ANDRES, CAFE ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",MEAT,,
DUCK,Coment,"Duck is great with fruit. We serve a duck with Seville oranges that are a little bitter. We made a puree ofthe pulp and a little peel that had nice acidity and bitterness. We then added fennel that had been cooked with butter and a little star anise. — DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)",MEAT,Citrus,ORANGE
DUCK,Coment,"For my dish oflacquered duck and peppercress, I make a duck cooked with honey served with a brown butter-honey that gives the duck a sweet, nutty flavor.

Then we blend this together with tahini, tomato water, buttermilk for acidity, lemon, and garlic. The soup is garnished with three gels made of eggplant, lemon, and onion — all flavors from the soup.

ESCALAR,Coment,"I have always loved to mix meat and fish in a very delicate way. I went to Cut [Wolfgang Puck's steak restaurant] and had my first true Kobe beef steak. I begged Lee [Hefter, the chef] for his source! Surfand turfis not as much about having a piece ofmeat and fish on the plate as about the ideas they create for flavor combinations. The Kobe beeftriggered everything. I can’t serve steak at a fish restaurant, but the Kobe was so good I had to find a way to justify it on the menu. I came up with Kobe beef and escalar, with a brown butter that is classic with the fish. The final dish was inspired by having Korean barbecue at a friend’s house, which is when I realized how to bring it together. I wanted another element in the dish because the Kobe, escalar, and brown butter are all rich and all soft. The dish also has squash, Japanese pears, and napa cabbage marinated like Korean kimchee for just a moment. These elements add contrast, chewiness, and crunchiness. — ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

FENNEL,Coment,"I like fennel shaved raw, with just some lemon juice, olive oil, and fennel seeds. Fennel goes well with dried meats like prosciutto. It also pairs nicely with shellfish like langoustines, lobster, or crab. Fennel can work with fish as well as with meat. It goes really well with cold poached salmon or white, light meats like chicken or veal. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
FENNEL,Coment,"Fennel is a flavor I like so much that I have to show restraint with it. You can add anything to it because other flavors really adhere to it. You can braise it in olive oil and veal stock to get one flavor. Or you can braise it in olive oil, white wine, and water and get a whole other flavor. Or you can quarter it, caramelize it, and roast it in the oven — now you have a sugar flavor and it can become a dessert. I love fennel every way including braised, caramelized, dried, candied, and pureed. In the fall, I served raw shaved fennel with arugula, and shaved Honeycrisp apple with a dressing made ofapple cider, honey, and mustard. Fennel puts the salad over the top with its crunch. In summer, we serve a fennel and fig tarte tatin with duck. You get a Fig Newton flavor from the fig and Pernod flavor from the fennel; they match really well. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO",,,

FENNEL POLLEN,Coment,"Fennel pollen has a light, fennel-anise flavor with a floral component. It is delicate, so you don’t cook with it — you just finish a dish with it. It is great on lighter things like salads, poached or steamed flaky white fish, poultry, or pork. When a dish has fennel pollen, even before the food hits your mouth you will notice a floral smell that gets you thinking ofsummer, lighter foods, and freshness. I use it with my sea trout dish, which is served with a simple salad ofgreen apple, fennel, jicama, pistachios, and dried gooseberries. The dish is topped with the pollen blended with some yogurt, lemon juice, and preserved lemon, which we drape over the fish. This dish just screams “summer.” With a glass of Sauvignon Blanc on the terrace in the early evening, you’re set! — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
FENNEL POLLEN,Coment,"I really like fennel pollen. The majority ofthe time, we use it in a marinade for meats like pork, boar, chicken, and lamb. It adds an interesting herbaceous, aromatic note and a mysterious flavor. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,,

Tuna even pairs with some ofthe same flavors as beef, including black pepper, red wine, and wasabi. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

I don’t believe you need 10,000 things for a great piece offish. Dover sole doesn’t need anything. Turbot has a wonderful flavor with no help. We get our baby octopus from Sicily and they have plenty offlavor. — ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY",,,

The tartefiambee developed from what was on hand on the farm: cheese and cream from the cow, pork from the pig, and onions from the field, which they added to some dough. Since we don’t have a wood-burning oven [in the middle of Manhattan], we have to tweak the recipe from the classic. We have to tweak the cream because ifwe don’t, it breaks and just becomes grease. Instead, I use a mix of fromage blanc, cream, and sour cream so I can get the same result as cream in the original. And to compensate for not having a fire, I use an applewood-smoked bacon. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

So, I created a savory cake topped with the icing. Then one day while I was online I heard someone mention Twinkies, and the next thing I knew I was ordering real Twinkie pans online. Three days later, Twinkies stuffed with foie gras was born. I serve it with fresh strawberries and black pepper. It seems like everything has been done already, but I like to think 1 am the only person working with Twinkies. — BOB IACOVONE, CUV^E (NEW ORLEANS)",,,

At the same time, tropical fruits like bananas or mangoes are not overly sweet fruits, so caramel can stand up to them. With tropical fruits, I will use a little lime juice and often rum as well to help give them a little kick. With mangoes, I use a little light brown sugar — or I’ll even blend light brown and white sugar together because I’ll want the flavor but not want it to be too harsh. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,

ofdishes, such as lamb. Garlic is also called for with all kinds of
vegetables, sauces, pastas, and salads.
— DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
GARLIC,Coment,"I use garlic primarily in two ways: infused into olive oil, or served
crispy as a garnish. I’ll use the garlic oil for cooking — and even if a
dish will have garlic added later, I will start with this oil. For crispy
brown garlic, you start by slicing it thinly like a chip. The garlic is then
put into cold olive oil and cooked until it is just brown. Then, you add
parsley, red pepper flakes, and an acid like lemon juice or vinegar to
make a vinaigrette. You can even add some stock like a fumet, which is
wonderful, too — served hot, it is great with almost any kind offish,
from something light all the way to oily blue fish.

Cucumber is a flavor that’s distinct yet delicate, and very refreshing. It
goes beautifully with a range offoods, from Asian cuisine to smoked
salmon.

— GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
GINGER,Coment,"I’ll use ginger more for its heat than its sweetness. For example, I’ll
juice it to add to a carrot or squash puree, which gives it heat and
backbone.
— BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE’S AT THE PHOENICIAN
(SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)",,,
GINGER,Coment,"Ginger is great on its own, but also works great with other flavors. It’s
one ofthose ""wake up"" flavors that you can hide beneath all sorts of
other flavors. I think it works especially well with citrus. It w'orks with
yuzu, passion fruit, coconut, banana, and other tropical flavors.
— MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
GINGER,Coment,"My mom always had candied ginger in the spice cupboard when I was
growing up. Today at the restaurant, we take candied ginger and
combine it with whatever fruit is in season — from nectarines, to
cherries, to quince — and then add Vin Santo to make a sauce for our
foie gras. Vin Santo brings nuttiness and candied ginger brings spice
that both cut through the fat ofthe foie gras. I think nectarines and
candied ginger are a perfect flavor combination.

HALIBUT,Coment,"Halibut from the East Coast is the most delicate and silky fish. It is
different than Alaskan halibut, which is drier, meatier, and more
robust. East Coast halibut is so delicate that anything can kill it. That is
why we steam and poach so much here: Even searing it too strongly in
the pan will hurt a piece of halibut.
We’ll poach halibut, then serve it with a blood orange vinaigrette
made with extra-virgin olive oil, which gives it a round and full flavor.
The fish is then served atop a carpaccio of golden beets that have been
cooked in sherry vinegar. The beets have a sweet-and-sour flavor to
them. They are also very crunchy, which I like with the creamy texture
ofthe halibut. The vinaigrette brings the right degree of acidity to the
dish to make it exciting.

HERBES DE PROVENCE,Coment,"I am more ofan herb guy than a spice guy. It comes back to a certain conservatism I have regarding food. The French are not big on spices; they use more herbs. I know the spices used in European cooking and use them in moderation. I am not going to serve a dish that is wildly nutmegged! — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","with Jerry Traunfeld of The Herbfarm, Woodinville, Washington",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","Working with herbs is very different from working with spices. Withherbs, you can really only work with a few at a time. With spices, you can throw so many more together. An Indian dish may have more than a dozen spices in it. Here are some guidelines:",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• Know your herb. Herbs range in intensity, so you need to know the profile of the herb you are choosing at the start. You need to be careful; for example, if you add rosemary to chervil it will overpower the chervil",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• You want to pair delicate with delicate or strong with strong. Chervil is possibly the most delicate herb. Lemon basil and lemon thyme would be in the middle. Lemon verbena or tarragon I would consider loud. Then you have bay leaf which is light, until you add twenty together and it becomes strong.",,Citrus,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• Not all herbs are created equal, and they can vary within their categories or season. Oregano can be mild, or hot and spicy. With mint, applemint is mild while peppermint is strong. The season also has an effect on rosemary, in the winter, rosemary is mild and in the summer, it is strong.",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• Herbs have regional affinities. Mediterranean herbs marry well together. Rosemary and marjoram or thyme and savory are naturals together. Among Asian herbs, lemongrass goes with mint and cilantro or mint and chives. In France, you have lots of combinations: chervil, tarragon, chives, and parsley. The one exception to France's herbs is tarragon, which is probably best on its own",,Citrus,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• Herbs also have seasonal affinities. Summer vegetables work with summer herbs, as do winter vegetables with winter herbs. In summer, it is basil or marjoram with tomatoes. Basil with zucchini is one of my favorite combinations. In winter, sage and rosemary work with potatoes and root vegetables. Also in winter, one of my favorite combinations is butternut squash with bay leaf and nutmeg. Pumpkin and bay leaf together make the pumpkin taste even more pumpkin-like.",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• How to use the chosen herb. Soft-leaved herbs — such as basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, lovage, and sorrel — shouldn't be cooked because they will lose their flavor. Toughleaved herbs — such as bay leaf, savory, and rosemary — can go into dishes and stand up to heat and cooking",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101","• Choose an herb that is the same intensity as your protein. Halibut is a gentle-tasting fish, which leads to gentle herbs like cilantro, chives, or chervil. Smelt is a local fish that is oily, so here we look to stronger herbs like oregano, savory, or rosemary.",,,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,"Herbs 101",• Herbs aren't exclusive to savory dishes. Anise hyssop works with most stone fruits like peaches. Cinnamon basil works with blue huckleberries. Cinnamon with blueberries really intensifies the flavor of the blueberry. Lavender works with plums or peaches. Lemony herbs like basil or anise hyssop work with watermelon. Rosemary works with apples or pears. Sage works with tart cherries. Tarragon works with muskmelon,,Citrus,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,Coment,"We grow forty different tomatoes and eight different basils. Our farmer planted the tomatoes surrounded by the basil, and I thought he did it because they taste good together. It turns out that doing so attracts beneficial insects to each. Our farmer believes that tomato and basil work so well on the plate because they work so well in the field. He also explained that ifyou plant certain basils next to tomatoes, you can taste it in the tomato. All our cooks take care oftheir own section ofthe herb garden. The garde-manger cooks [who prepare appetizers] look after the chives and chervil. The fish cooks care for the lemon herbs like lemon thyme and lemongrass, and the meat cooks for the rosemary, sage, and thyme. Our pastry cooks tend the edible flowers that can be candied, and mint and lemon verbena, which they use in sorbets. — DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)",,Citrus,
HERBES DE PROVENCE,Coment,"I am a big fan ofroasting and resting meat on herbs. If you roast a rib eye, prime rib, or filet mignon, most people would put it on a sheet tray with a roasting rack. One day, I didn’t have a roasting rack but I had a lot ofthyme and savory and rosemary, so I threw the meat on top and roasted it. The technique did the trick by keeping the meat from the juices and it also enhanced the flavor that much more. Since then, we have stopped using roasting racks for our meats and switched to herbs. During the roasting process, 1 like to turn the meat so that the flavor ofthe herbs penetrates even more. Since you are roasting in a closed oven, the air circulates the herb flavor. For a lamb shoulder, ifyou can’t get hay, I would recommend using savory, thyme, sage, and rosemary. This technique is great for a whole chicken: slice some truffles to put under the chicken skin, brush it with butter, and put it on a bed ofsavory and thyme. It will be pretty incredible. — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)",,,

HORSERADISH,Coment,"Heating grated horseradish changes the horseradish completely. It makes it more mellow and takes away the bite while keeping its jummy flavor. Horseradish prepared this way works well with Nantucket Bay scallops that are naturally sweet and work with the sweetness ofthe horseradish. We will also use it in a lemony vinaigrette and dress a smoked trout with it. First, grate horseradish on a microplane [a fine grater]. Coat a teninch skillet with some Ligurian olive oil, and heat the horseradish over medium heat. Watch it very closely, because the minute it starts to turn from its blond color, it is done. From there, transfer it into cold pans to cool it quickly. When it is totally cool and has its crunch, add some lemon zest and kosher salt. — HOLLY SMITH, CAFE LUANITA (SEATTLE)",,Citrus,

I serve rare roasted venison in venison stock with hot and sweet paprika that is essentially a goulash. Alongside, I serve creamed sauerkraut that bleeds into the sauce and gives the same effect as a goulash. Even though the sauerkraut has an intense flavor, it is still mild because it has been cooked in cream. It is not a Hungarian dish but rather a play on a Hungarian dish, and it works in the context ofthe subtler intensity offlavors I like. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,

making Italian cuisine. In fact, making an Indian curry is a lot like
making an Italian tomato sauce.
— MEERU DHALWALA, VIJ'S (VANCOUVER)",CUISINE,,
INDIAN CUISINE,Coment,"Ifmy mind is in India, tamarind will be sneaking its way into the dish. When thinking of India, my inspirations are the flavors of clove, cardamom, and coriander seed. They are aromatic spices that really cut the fat ofthe dish, so it is not big, fat, and flabby on the palate. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,
INDIAN CUISINE,Coment,"I worked in an Indian restaurant as a waiter for four years. I love cooking with Indian ingredients. Everything I learned at the CIA was thrown out the window when I learned Indian cooking, which is where I picked up many techniques and philosophies. I now roast my own spices and create spice blends. I love creating my own flavor combinations. I came to love a garam masala made with fennel, cinnamon, clove, cumin, and coriander. Each ofthese five spices has a distinctive flavor, but combined they create one single flavor that is amazing. I will use my garam masala mixture in soups and sauces. When people ask about the dish, they always ask, “What was that flavor?"" — BOB IACOVONE, CUV^E (NEW ORLEANS)",CUISINE,,

"ITALIAN CUISINE, SOUTHERN",RECIPE,"Holly Smith of Cafe Juanita in Seattle on Five Flavors that Will Take You to Northern Italy White Truffles.                                                                                                                                                      The perfect vehicle for white truffles is hand-cut pasta that is egg rich. Eggs that taste like real eggs make a great pasta. Our pasta is egg rich and has 35 egg yolks to a kilo (2.2 pounds) of flour. You can get them in there, it is crazy! The pasta looks like a sunset. On the pasta, I would first put butter barely scented with sage, before shaving the truffles on top. Nebbiolo. Beef cheeks braised in Nebbiolo [wine]. To keep it simple, we serve roasted turnips and the reduced sauce with pomegranate seeds and that's it. We braise our cheeks for seven and a half hours. Most braised dishes go four hours, but not beef cheeks — anything less, and they are [still tough]. Anchovies. I love a really acidic anchovy vinaigrette for a bread salad. Anchovies with roasted garlic are like butter at this restaurant; they go in lots of dishes. We put them in lamb, we put them in between potatoes with chicken stock for a gratin. We love them. I like anchovies with sage on each side deep fried for an appetizer. We cook anchovies in olive oil with a little butter until they get toasty, throw in onions to caramelize, and serve this with fish. Hazelnuts. Chocolate and hazelnut is the perfect combination so we make gianduja and put it inside crepes and warm them and put chestnut honey on top. Most of the time hazelnuts end up in salad or ground for a final dusting for a pasta. Beet pasta that looks like candy wrappers is served on top of a warm plate that has just been smeared with Gorgonzola Piccante, then topped with ground hazelnuts just before it is served. Blue cheese and hazelnuts is it for me. Goat Meat. I just had spit-roasted goat at Da Cesare. If I knew I was going to die, I would get myself there [to the Piedmont region of Italy]. Roasted goat basted with garlic, olive oil, marjoram, mint, or rosemary is it.",CUISINE,,

I can’t precisely place its flavor, which is somewhere between a turnip, radish, and cauliflower. But it tastes great and is really versatile. You can grill it, roast it, glaze it like a carrot, or make a gratin out ofit with potatoes. We have even grated it and made a remoulade out ofit like you would with a celery root. But the best way to enjoy kohlrabi is grilled, roasted, and drizzled with olive oil and sea salt. That is my favorite! — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)",,,

LAMB — IN GENERAL,Coment,"Our signature wine-marinated lamb popsicles in fenugreek cream curry on spinach potatoes dish is bare rugged simplicity. You have rack oflamb that has been cooked just a few minutes. Then you have a simple sauce that is essentially just cream and garlic — and you can taste all three. We add some green fenugreek that gives an earthiness to tire dish and takes it to a whole new level. It is incredibly simple. It is a dish about technique because ifthe garlic is cooked too long, it gets bitter. Or ifyou add too much fenugreek, it gets bitter and overpowers tire cream. But in tire right proportions, it is perfect. — MEERU DHALWALA, VU’S (VANCOUVER)",,,
LAMB — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I work with a local lamb farmer in the Willamette Valley who has true spring lamb in the spring. We have a spit and every Friday night we roast a whole lamb. 1 am a big fan oflamb shoulder. It can take a beating and in the end come out glorious tasting! There is an old French technique where they cook ham in hay. The hay is submerged in water; then they put the ham on it to cook. It is amazing. We adapted this technique to the lamb. We had our farmer collect the hay and grass in tire field where the lamb grazed with the titinking that this is what the lamb actually ate. We then dry the hay by letting it sit out overnight on a tray, so it becomes really butterscotchy and bamyardy. You can use any hay for this technique but I’m just a purist. We brine a boneless shoulder oflamb for 24 hours in a brining solution of 1 cup ofsalt and '/, cup ofsugar in a gallon ofwater, [adding] some peppercorns, bay leaf, a couple of cardamom pods, a cinnamon stick, and cumin. The brine is brought to a boil, cooled down, and the lamb goes in. After the brining we rub the lamb with garlic and summer savory and tie it up into a log and put it on the bed ofhay, drizzle it with white wine, cover it, and put it in tire oven. It is nature going back on itself. Tire lamb ate the hay, the hay makes the lamb taste better. When it’s cooked, the flavors are intense but pleasant and it becomes something else. When lavender is in season, 1’11 throw some in the hay as well and it is delicious. With the lamb I like to serve a stuffed tomato Provencal [typically a combination of basil, bread crumbs, garlic, olive oil]. You want to serve something simple. You could also serve a crushed potato with savory and olive oil or a medley ofvegetables. — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND. OREGON)",,,

LEMONS,Coment,"We have lemon juice right next to the salt when we cook. Acid is the
most important aspect ofhow a dish tastes — whether it is there as
subtle punctuation or an exclamation point!
— SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,Citrus,
LEMONS,Coment,"Lemon zest adds a totally different dynamic than lemon juice. Ifyou are making an apple crisp, ifyou added a teaspoon ofzest it would taste very different than ifyou added lemon juice. The juice would make it taste tart, whereas the zest would actually add a lemon flavor component to it. For ice cream, custards, and tarts, use lemon juice. But if you are going to combine lemon with other flavors, that’s when you use zest. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,
LEMONS,Coment,"Use lemon juice when you want the acid and lemony flavor ofthe juice. Ifyou want the perfume ofthe lemon, use the zest because the skin is where you get the essential oils. I use more lemon and orange than vanilla in my cooking because they are more prevalent in Italy and in Italian cooking, and a flavor profile that people recognize as Italian. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,ORANGE
LEMONS,Coment,"Lemon can be used by itselfor with other ingredients because it enhances so many flavors. An orange can be a little too mellow, but lemon makes flavors much brighter. Lemon is an underlying flavor as much as the star. Ifthere is one fruit you had to always have on hand as a basic staple, it is lemon. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,ORANGE

After eight months or a year, you see God. They become incredible just by waiting those extra few months. I make preserved lemons by feel. I primarily use salt and will add some cinnamon, clove, nigella, a tiny, tiny bit ofsaffron, and then just tuck them away in the refrigerator.

LOBSTER,Coment,"I love lobster: poached, roasted, or grilled. I like mayonnaise or a vinaigrette with my lobster much more than butter with lobster. In the summertime, I like it with small potatoes and corn. I really like it with cilantro. For my dish Roasted Maine Lobster in “Folly of Herbs” with Baby Fennel and Salsify, I wanted to do something different with lobster besides a lobster sauce. I make a “tea” ofdried herbs: thyme, rosemary, fennel seeds, oregano, sage, mint, and tarragon. This is boiled and strained, then gets a dash ofRicard [also known as Pernod, an aniseflavored liquor]. The lobster gets finished with fresh parsley, mint, and fresh oregano. I chose these two vegetables because salsify is underused and underappreciated. I don’t blanch my salsify in water because when you do, the flavor stays in the water. I roast them and caramelize them a little bit, then deglaze with just a little water with a sprig ofthyme and a bay leaf. Baby fennel is good because it plays offthe Ricard and fennel. I quickly blanch the fennel and then caramelize it. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

MACADAMIA NUTS,Matching,"Macadamia nuts are buttery, rich nuts. I will even pair them with sea scallops, which also have a richness to them. The macadamia nuts don’t overwhelm the scallops and I put them in the dish slightly chopped — otherwise, the texture ofthe nut would be too chewy. We use macadamia nuts on one ofthe simplest yet most popular dishes on our menu — our jumbo lump crab cake with grilled asparagus and toasted macadamia nuts. Our crab cake is the only recipe we won’t give out. It contains no herbs or spices. The only thing that goes in our crab cake is crab, salt, pepper, panko [Japanese bread crumbs], and a little mayonnaise to hold them together. You are the first people to get this recipe! — MARCEL DESAULNIERS. THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)",,,

MENU,Coment,"When planning a menu, pick the dessert or the entree first and have the other one match it, in terms ofstyle and preparation. Ifyou are doing an entree that requires last-minute time in the kitchen, don’t serve a dessert that requires last-minute time as well. Ifyou have a main course that takes last-minute work, serve a dessert that can be made a day ahead — or ifyour dessert is what needs last-minute attention, serve it after a stew or lasagna. When deciding what to make, remember: The heavier the main course, the lighter the dessert should be, or vice versa. I was recently going through some ofmy earlier books and was shocked when I looked at the recipes. One recipe for a chocolate cake that we served at Stars was served in big wedges. I was amazed we used to serve such a huge portion! People can't eat like that anymore. At the same time, the cake is so good I still want to serve it so I work backward. I will serve a chicken or something else light for the main course, not a prime rib ofbeef. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

MEXICAN CUISINE,Coment,"Creating new dishes has to be more titan simply intensifying flavors for dishes. In terms ofvisual presentation, we are shifting into a new direction where the food looks like one thing, but is really something else. That adds an extra element of challenge for us. An example ofthis would be a [Mexican-inspired] nacho dish we just created. You get something that looks like chips, sour cream, salsa verde, and grated cheese. The cheese is actually grated from saffron ice cream that we have thrown into liquid nitrogen, that is put into a food processor grater. The salsa verde is made from kiwi, mint puree, and epozote to give it a little twist. The sour cream is a yuzu creme fraiche. The chips are made from pureed com tortilla chips that have been sweetened with powdered sugar, then pasted into triangles and deep fried. So you get something that looks like nachos, but tastes completely different. So we are taking a visual aspect ofsomething you are comfortable with and serving it at the end ofa twenty-course meal. — HOMARO CANTU, MOTO (CHICAGO",CUISINE,,

MINT — IN GENERAL,Coment,"With mint, applemint is mild, while peppermint is strong. — JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",,,
MINT — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I was actually brought up in the school ofthought that put a sprig ofmint on every dessert. I am not that guy anymore. I have a saying — “NFG” — which stands for two things at once: “nonfunctional garnishes” are “no fucking good.” If something doesn’t make sense to the dish, it won’t be there. I hate ordering lamb and seeing a huge bunch ofrosemary alongside it. Put it in the dish — let me taste it! — JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
MINT — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I love mint flavor, but some cooks started throwing mint on desserts just because they liked the color ofit. Ifyou have a gorgeous strawberry shortcake and add some mint to it, one oftwo things will happen: i) Either you don’t eat it, so what’s the point of putting it on the plate in the first place, or 2) If you do eat it, that one mint leafwill completely change the balance ofthe dessert. Ifyou have a lemon tart that is mostly perfectly balanced lemon curd with a little whipped cream and you add a mint leafto the dessert, the leafwill play havoc with that balance. So don’t throw mint on a plate haphazardly, or you’ll throw offthe balance ofthe entire dessert. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,LEMON
MINT — IN GENERAL,Coment,"The first place I think ofwith mint is Morocco. From there, it is the Middle East. Mint and lamb is such a natural combination, as is mint and yogurt. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
MINT — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I don’t use mint very much, but I have a serious thing for black peppermint! You will see it in one form or another on my menu. I go to the farmers’ market twice a week and use it all summer. It is great with berries. It works best with something light like an infusion or granita. Last summer, we made a tangy lychee gelee that was served under oven-roasted Tristar strawberries tossed lightly with balsamic vinegar. On top ofthe strawberries, we scooped the black peppermint sorbet. — JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

MISO AND MISO SOUP,Matching,"I will use several different misos, depending on the purpose. I might use saikyo, a light, yellow, sweet miso, in marinades or with lighter fish like sweet shrimp and scallops that would be overwhelmed by dark miso. Barley miso is a distinctive strong, sweet miso that I’ll use with nigiri with baby squid and shiso. I’ll use wheat miso with foie gras.

MOROCCAN CUISINE,Coment,"I don’t know the first thing about Moroccan cooking other than eating Moroccan food and owning Paula Wolfert's book [Couscous], but I serve a lamb dish in Moroccan spices. I braise lamb shanks in cumin, saffron, and preserved lemon, with the juice being turned into a sauce. The lamb shanks are then boned and put into a cake with eggplant and molded onto a plate. This is not Moroccan cooking per se, but it suggests the flavors ofMorocco. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,Citrus,LEMON

on Cooking with Mushrooms
Mushrooms Year-Round
Spring. This is the start of the morel season. One of the reasons I came to work in Oregon was one day I was working in a kitchen in France and a box of morels arrived with a
tag on it that said ""Oregon.""
Summer. The morels dwindle away, and we get a brief stint of porcini/cepes. Late
summer is golden and white chanterelle season.
Fall. The porcini come back and we also get in matsutake mushrooms as well. We
have [Pacific Northwest] black and white truffles here and the season starts in November.
They are pretty flavorful but it is important to realize they are different from European
truffles — not to mention a lot less expensive.
I’m not a big fan of cultivated mushrooms but I do like a few. King oyster or trumpet
royal are the same mushroom and it is one of my favorites. Portobellos are also good,
though they are a little ‘70s.
I am suspicious of some dried mushrooms you find in the supermarket only because
you don't know how old they are and how much flavor they will have.

Buying and Cleaning Mushrooms
When it comes to mushrooms, every kind needs to be well cleaned because there is nothing worse than getting a mouthful of grit. I wash them all by soaking them in a bowl of
water and pulling them out. The key to remember is that you want to use mushrooms
soon after washing them. Don't wash them a day ahead.
For morel mushrooms, you need to know how to cook them, and slicing them up
fresh and throwing them in a pan is not it. It is very important to clean them and I recommend blanching them. Fill a pot with cold water, toss in a handful of salt and then the
mushrooms. Bring the pot to a boil, scoop out the mushrooms, spread them out, and
lightly squeeze them dry. As you dry them, take a good look at them to make sure they
are free of twigs and such.

Seasoning Mushrooms
When it comes to seasoning mushrooms, savory works across the board. The seasoning
combination that I’ve used in my kitchen from day one is a raw parsley and garlic combination that in French is called persillade. After the mushrooms have been sauteed in butter or olive oil, at the last second you toss in this combination with a pinch of salt. That is
all a mushroom needs most of the timel
If you are roasting porcini or king oyster mushrooms, roast them on a bed of savory
or thyme for extra flavor.",,,

MUSTARD,Coment,"Good cooking transcends all cultures. You can take inspiration from all around the world and apply it to what you are cooking without making it “fusion.” In some cases, you can even take a classic and make it taste better. I worked with Floyd Cardoz [chef ofthe Indian restaurant Tabla in New York City] and learned a lot about Indian spicing and technique from him. One technique was turka, which is where you fry spices in oil or ghee [Indian clarified butter] until they pop. It really opens up the flavor ofthe spices. I use this cross-cultural technique when making a veal dish with a great mustard sauce, which is a classic French dish, and the result is not a fusion dish: Take black, yellow, and red mustard seeds and toast them in butter or olive oil until they pop; then add some shallots and vermouth and reduce it. Then, add veal stock with a splash ofcream and Dijon mustard. The result is a very complex sauce with a much deeper flavor, versus simply combining some cream and mustard together in the pan. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
MUSTARD,Coment,"Tarragon leads me to mustard which leads me to shellfish — which leads me to mussels. The combination ofthe three is delicious. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)",RECIPE,"Marcel Desaulniers of The Trellis in Williamsburg, Virginia, on Nuts
We use a great deal of nuts at the restaurant. On our fall menu, we have nuts in six out of ten entrees. Using
nuts has always been one of my hallmarks in terms of adding texture to everything from a salad or soup to entrees and desserts. This philosophy hasn't changed much since 1987 when I opened. I can't think of a nut that
doesn't, in essence, work in both sweet and savory dishes",,,

"NUTS — IN GENERAL
(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)",Coment,"I love nuts, and put them in everything. I find that almost all nuts pair well with a lot of different things. When I am creating a dessert, I will choose my nuts geographically. For example, if 1 am making a Sicilian dessert, I'll use pistachios because that is the nut they would use [in Sicily]. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
"NUTS — IN GENERAL
(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)",Coment,"The quality ofchopped nuts can never compare with the quality of whole nuts. In 26 years, we have never bought chopped pecans because the quality is so different, despite the fact that it would be a lot less
expensive
I recommend simply chopping by hand or, in the case ofsomething
like a pecan, breaking it with your fingers. Pecans have so much
moisture that ifyou chop them, you lose what is special about their
texture. People tend to put nuts into the food processor and the next
thing you know, you have powder and not pieces.
We always toast our nuts, 100 percent ofthe time. Nuts absorb a lot
ofmoisture, so by toasting them you dry them out and heighten the
flavor. You do need to be careful, because they bum so easily. Slower
roasting is better. With a nut like a cashew, you want to roast them at 325 degrees to get them to be a nice, golden brown
— MARCEL DESAULNIERS. THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG. VIRGINIA)",,,
"NUTS — IN GENERAL
(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)",Coment,"Always toast nuts to bring up the flavor. Ifyou don’t toast the nuts before adding them to a dish, they tend to come out soggy when the dish is done. The one exception would be ifthey are going on top ofa tart going into the oven, because then they would be overtoasted.
Nut work great in adding texture, especially to creamy and/or moussey desserts. The other way to balance out richness is with some phyllo dough -— EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
"NUTS — IN GENERAL
(See also Pecans, Walnuts, etc.)",Coment,"Juicing nuts is the new thing we are doing. We’ll juice almonds,
hazelnuts, and — best of all — pine nuts, which comes out like pine nut butter. Juicing pine nuts is better than grinding them, because it
pulverizes their fat. We put that on some local green beans with
preserved lemon zest, to serve with spring onions with lamb.
— ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON
"NUTS — IN GENERAL

is chestnuts.

OIL,Coment,"On Selecting the Right Oil

Your choice ofolive oil always depends on what you are using it for. 
In general, you don’t want an oil that is super-assertive, green, or peppery.
You want a good olive flavor. I use a 100 percent Italian blend. It is silly to cook with too percent extra-virgin olive oil ifyou are just sauteing something. 
Ifthe oil is going to stay in what you are making, like a sauce, then start with extra-virgin olive oil. When I make a tomato sauce, that is what I am starting with.
Ifyou are finishing a dish, that is also when you would use an
assertive, more full-flavored oil. I also like to use nut oils, especially those made by Jean Leblanc. They are insane; his oils are so good that after you taste them, nothing else will do! 1 especially like to use nut oils in the fall.
I use walnut oil dressing on salads, especially those salads that accompany meat.
Ifyou make a foie gras dish with apples and endive, an addition of walnut oil would be great.
— ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)

Olive oil comes in a wide variety offlavors and strengths even from the same region, much like wine:
• I use a heavier (e.g., Puglian, Umbrian, Sicilian) olive oil on biggerflavored dishes. A strong olive oil goes well on bean puree or a strong vegetable like dandelion greens. In the United States, you would put a barbecue sauce on a grilled meat; in Italy, you would use a strong olive oil.

• I use a lighter (e.g., Ligurian, Tuscan) olive oil on lighter meats like veal
or fish dishes and pastas. A Ligurian olive is full and bright and
is great on a lighter dish.
— ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)

• I like to use single varietal olive oil from Australia and New Zealand.
Australian olive oils can be like their wines: big, pungent, and spicy. 
New Zealand oils have a little more depth offlavor and green grassiness.

"PAPRIKA, SMOKED",Coment,"We use lots ofsmoked paprika, but need to be careful because it can be really strong. I like to finish our fried chickpeas with this because it makes them taste like they just jumped out ofthe fire! We also like to mix our paprikas together, typically in equal proportions ofsweet, hot, and smoked. Smoked paprika is primarily smoky and doesn’t have a lot of other flavors. So ifyou combine it with a vibrant sweet paprika, you’ll get a more rounded pepper flavor. Paprika is also very regional. In the south [of Spain] where it gets sunshine and heat, you see more smoked paprika, but in the north where it is colder and rainy, they are not into the heat. — ALEXANDRA RAM, TiA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

PARSLEY,Coment,"The Spanish use parsley stems for cooking, and fresh as a garnish before serving. When you make rice or beans, you would put a stem in. To me, parsley added to fish or shellfish makes the dish tastes more “marine,” as opposed to earthy. I love salsa verde, which is a sauce made with basically a ton of parsley, garlic, and some kind ofjuice like clam juice. It’s wonderful served with fish. — ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TIA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
PARSLEY,Coment,"People do not understand parsley; they think it is green specks. But it is wonderful with fish. If you make a straight-up linguini with clam sauce, you want a big handful ofchopped parsley in there — not for the appearance, but for the taste. It is an important component in a lot of dishes and needs to be there. It can also be used as a sauce all on its own. Ifyou sprinkle it on a steak, it will not have the impact that it would on fish. On the other hand, if you make a Maitre d’hotel butter [butter flavored with lemon juice and parsley] and put it on the steak, the parsley has a role there. On vegetables, ifyou make glazed carrots or pearl onions or a stew with lots ofvegetables, parsley stirred in at the last moment is good stuff. As for my choice of parsley, I always use flat Italian-style parsley. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON
PARSLEY,Coment,"Salsa verde is my favorite all-purpose condiment at home. I like it on fish, lamb, and steak. It is made with anchovy, garlic, shallots, olive oil, and herbs — primarily parsley, but also chervil, chives, tarragon, a little bit ofmarjoram, and sometimes a little mint ifI am in the mood. I add the acid at the last moment so it won’t change the color ofthe herbs, and will choose between Banyuls or red wine vinegar, or lemon juice. IfI am serving meat, I will use vinegar; ifI am serving fish, I will use lemon. Even though it changes color once the acid is added, it lasts a few days. It is really good on a piece ofbread or with some fresh farmer’s cheese as a snack. — TRACI DES JARDINS, JARDINIERE (SAN FRANCISCO)",,Citrus,LEMON

PASTA,RECIPE,"Pairing Pastas with Sauces

Which sauces pair best with which pastas? We asked chef Odette Fada of New York City's San Domenico restaurant.
• Angel hair In Italy, angel hair pasta is served to old people who can’t chew. It's for grandparents, or for others to eat when they are sick. The problem with angel hair pasta is it's so thin it's hard to cook al dente, and I like my pasta a little chewy.
• Bow tie: Fresh bow tie is great when made by hand, because it stays folded and doesn’t open into a square. I like to serve it with vegetables and tomato-based sauces.
• Fettuccine: This is a flavorful pasta and is good with a Bolognese sauce.
• Fusilli: I like their [corkscrew] shape, but they tend to break easily so they are not that attractive when you cook them in a restaurant setting. I like them at home in a salad or with some pesto because the pesto sticks to it.
• Hollow pasta [e.g., macaroni, penne, rigatoni): Good with sauces that have big chunks in them so that the sauce pieces go inside whole. I like to do penne with fresh peas because the peas will slip inside, so you’ll sometimes get a little surprise when you're chewing.
• Pappardelle: This is a strong, rustic pasta. I like it with rabbit sauce, a ragout, or a fish sauce that has some character.
• Small pasta [e.g., rice-, shell-, or star-shaped): These are good for soups and brothy dishes. For example, you would use them with a brothy fish dish.
• Spaghetti: Everything goes with spaghetti! It is a pasta that sauce sticks to. Everything from tomato sauce to pesto to pecorino with black pepper is great with spaghetti.

> Or, if you’re starting with the sauce:

Carbonara: Spaghetti or bucatini, you want a pasta that the sauce will stick to.
• Cream: Fettuccine, pappardelle, or gnocchi, since cream is so rich you want a strongflavored pasta or, in the last case, gnocchi — one that is made with some egg in it.
• Game: Pappardelle or fettuccine; you want an egg-rich pasta with some flavor.
• Olive oil and garlic Spaghetti.
• Pesto: Fusilli.
• Tomato: This works with almost all pasta shapes, from small to large.

I have played with lots of flavored pasta doughs. One of my favorites is olive because it holds its flavor. Otherflavors that hold up well are squid ink and saffron. I have also made a pappardelle with cocoa powder that I paired with game sauce that worked great. If you wanted to achieve a particular color, you could create red pasta with beets, green pasta with spinach, and black pasta with squid ink.",,,
PASTA,RECIPE,"Chef Odette Fada of New York's San Domenico on Making Ravioli

I love ravioli! Anything and everything goes in my ravioli — I have used everything from chestnuts to cheese to fish,
meat, and vegetables. You can vary the ravioli dough as well as the stuffing. For example, I serve ravioli stuffed with sea urchin and the dough is light and made with just flour and water. For a stronger filling like lamb, I will use some egg in the dough which makes it bigger flavored.
One of my favorite ravioli stuffings is black truffle and pancetta. The truffle provides a crunchiness when you bite into it.
One of the greatest ravioli we do dates back to the chef for the last king of Italy at the beginning of the twentieth
century. It is stuffed with spinach, truffle, Parmesan cheese, and an egg yolk, and  served with butter, truffle, and Parmesan cheese. When the ravioli is cooked, it is served with the yolk warm but not cooked. It is truly an amazing dish.
In Italy during the winter, you would typically have some slices of sausage on top of a plate of lentils. I decided to combine the two into a ravioli dish. Now, one of my other favorite dishes is our ravioli stuffed with cotechino [sausage] and lentils. The lentils are cooked with rosemary, garlic, extra-virgin olive oil, and prosciutto skin, and go into the ravioli with the sausage, parsley, and Parmesan cheese. The dish is finished with some strong extra-virgin olive oil, parsley, and a crack of pepper",,,

PEACHES,Coment,"I try not to cook peaches, or ifI do, only for a short amount oftime. A peach pie never tastes as good to me as a blueberry pie, because it tastes too cooked by the time you get it thick enough. So ifI get peaches, I’ll chop them up and put them on a tart shell that is already cooked instead. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
PEACHES,Coment,"I like peaches with rich, round flavors like vanilla and honey. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
PEACHES,Coment,"Japanese baby peaches are tiny peaches about the size of olives. We wanted to showcase the peaches and thought, What do peaches go with? Cream. We took that one step further and used yogurt instead. So we chose Greek yogurt, paired it with the peaches, then garnished the dish with Hawaiian pink sea salt, Greek olive oil, reduced balsamic vinegar, and micro mint. We turned the water strained from the yogurt into “air” [ foam]. This is a dish that we serve as a pre-dessert and it works well because it is sweet and savory. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

PEARS,Coment,"This salad has roasted pear, Roquefort cheese, lemon, and olive oil and is garnished with borage flowers. The sauce is burnt caramel with pepper deglazed with Coteaux du Layon, which is sweet but higher in acid than Sauternes. The caramel sauce keeps you awake! Cheese andfruit: Blue cheese is sharp and hits your palate, then the pear calms it down. Salad greens: We use herbs in our salad and this one has fennel, thyme, tarragon, parsley, and anise hyssop. Borageflowers: Eating a borage flower is like eating an oyster! It is briny. In the summer when they are in season, if you taste a couple it is reminiscent of a mild oyster. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON
PEARS,Coment,"Apples are more popular than pears because when you go to the store, pears are all hard. You buy them, bring them home, and wait forever for them to ripen. You have to have a premeditated use for pears. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
PEARS,Coment,"I like pears poached because I’m not fond oftheir texture. I also make a pear tart with pears poached in lemon zest and vanilla, and then combined with custard, honey, lemon, and vanilla. It is paired with a honey grappa zabaglione and topped with grated Pecorino Toscano cheese grated over it as ifit were pasta. The dish sounds a little crazy but all these flavors are classic combinations found in Italy. Pears are often infused with grappa in the north ofItaly. Pears, honey, and pecorino is a classic combination in Tuscany. Pecorino goes with every flavor. Honey carries all the flavors forward. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY",,Citrus,LEMON

"PEPPER, BLACK",Coment,"I like white pepper with most white fish, and black pepper with tuna and red meat. White pepper works with halibut because it does not overwhelm the fish. Black pepper has a complex flavor and is spicy, which can be distracting. The problem with many peppers like cayenne or chipotle is that they are so strong they can burn. That is not a problem for me, but it is for our clientele. We use piment d’Espelette, which is spicy but sweet. — ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",SPICE,,
"PEPPER, BLACK",Coment,"You have to be careful with black pepper because it can be a vehicle to add flavor — but ifmisused, it will mask flavor. I might add the tiniest little pinch before a dessert gets served to punch it up. I use black pepper with fresh fruit, especially cherries. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",SPICE,,
"PEPPER, BLACK",Coment,"To me, tuna doesn’t even taste like tuna anymore unless it's seared with my pepper mix oftoasted and ground black and pink peppercorns, coriander, and star anise. The same mix is also great on beef, buffalo, and venison. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",SPICE,,
"PEPPER, BLACK",Coment,"We don’t have sixteen types of pepper here; we use a basic black Tellicherry peppercorn and a little bit ofred pepper flakes. I will occasionally go to an Asian market to get a pepper that has a sweet element to it, as these also tend to have a fruitiness to them that works well in braised dishes. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",SPICE,,

I stuffthem with goat cheese and wrap them in Serrano ham before frying them. You get sweetness and spice from the peppers, saltinessfrom the ham, creaminess from the cheese, and crunchiness from the frying Doing so gives them so much flavor, I don’t need to add anything else.

"PEPPERS, SPANISH",Coment,"Guindilla peppers are used to give heat in Spanish cooking. If you were cooking beans, you would add your parsley sprig, half an onion, garlic, carrot, and one guindilla pepper. Nora peppers are smoked, bell-shaped peppers from Catalonia used for romesco sauce. They are similar to Mexican guajillo peppers.
Chorizero peppers are bittersweet. Their pulp is used in salsa vizcaina, which is a red sauce made with a lot of onions cooked down sweet, the chorizero pepper pulp, and either fish or bean stock. It’s great served on fish or tripe.

PERSIMMONS,Coment,"Because ofthe texture and unique flavor of a persimmon, no matter what you do it will always taste like persimmon pudding. I decided two years ago to stop trying to do anything else with persimmons. Why try and reinvent the wheel? To work with persimmons, you first put them in the freezer overnight to ripen, then peel and puree them. Persimmons are pretty astringent, so you need to add a lot ofspices and sugar to them. The combination of allspice, cinnamon, and ginger that you see in traditional recipes is nice with persimmons, and adds an interesting complexity to the flavor. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

PICKLES,Coment,"I lived in Japan for two years where I fell in love with pickles and pickling. For pickling, I use the proportions that are common for seasoning Japanese sushi rice, though I’ll admit that there might be a sushi chef out there who might disagree with me: 9 parts vinegar to 5 parts sugar, 1 part salt, and 1 part water. Pickles are one ofthose things I love to have in my pantry because they are so fun to use and make so many things yummy. It is definitely one ofmy tricks that I keep stashed away. I like to pickle Swiss chard stems with raw beets and star anise. They are great together and work as a garnish on our Nantucket Bay scallop dish. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
PIAAENTON (See also Paprika),Coment,"1 don’t even like to use the word “paprika"" when referring to pimenton. It is not the same as Hungarian paprika, which is just dried pepper and doesn't taste like anything else. The Spanish were the first to plant peppers. Our pimenton has the right touch of sweetness, bitterness, and smoke. Used in a dish it makes the dish a whole new thing. Sprinkled on octopus, it is astonishing. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFE ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

They can be pretty mild so they are less about flavor and more about color and texture. Since pistachios are so mild I like to feature them solo or in a large quantity so they don’t get lost.

POMEGRANATES,Coment,"What is nice about pomegranates is that they are very flavorful but don’t have a lot ofsugar in them. They also have a unique flavor that is not like anything else. It is one ofthe few flavors that have come around in popularity because they have made it easier to use [via pomegranate juice, molasses, etc.]. Cleaning them to use just the seeds can be a pain in the neck. However, I use the juice because it makes a great sorbet. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,

In the summertime, to keep it light, we won’t even add wine. — DAN BARBER, BLUE HILL AT STONE BARNS (POCANTICO HILLS, NEW YORK)",MEAT,,

I was a pretty picky eater growing up, but I loved my macaroni and cheese, and bacon and eggs. I came up with a take on bacon and eggs substituting pork belly for the bacon. I love pork belly — it is a poor man’s foie gras, the way it just melts in your mouth. I make the eggs in a double boiler that gives them a creamy texture, and finish them with fresh herbs. For the belly, we grill it and then braise it in citrus, champagne vinegar, and veal stock for six hours. Then at serving, we grill it again and top it with a “sweet heat"" sauce which is like a barbecue sauce with layers and layers offlavor. — BOB IACOVONE, CUVfE (NEW ORLEANS)",MEAT,Citrus,

I wanted a contrasting flavor, so I added some sweet meringue as. a garnish.

"RABBIT (See also Game —

This is a light and beautifully balanced dish that reminds me of Liguria [in Italy], The olives are salty, the marjoram is strong, and the fennel is sweet. This has been on our menu for over a year but it took me a few tries to get right. I tried black olives, but they were too strong. I tried rosemary, but it was too earthy. I tried Brussels sprouts, but they were a little too bitter and didn’t complement the same way sweet fennel did. So though the combination didn’t work for the saddle, the black olives and rosemary led me to add some rabbit liver and stuffa whole boned rabbit. That dish did work. The two dishes were different in the sense that the saddle with the green olives was a little more sophisticated while the whole rabbit was more of a peasant dish. Customers like both! — ODETTE FADA, SAN DOMENICO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

RADISHES,Flavor Affinities,"There is a time ofyear when all there seems to be in the green market is radishes. You get sick ofseeing them and they are there for months. I needed to create something new and all there was were radishes. So, I came up with a radish salad served with lobster. We blanch turnip rounds and fold in a little baby ginger to get this wonderfully peppery salad. The sauce until the lobster is a pistachio vinaigrette that is bound by onion puree and brightened by the juice that pickled the ginger. We finish the dish with toasted pistachios and add a pistachio oil. The pistachio nut and oil add an earthy quality and depth offlavor to the dish. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

RASPBERRIES,Coment,"When working with raspberries, I will try not to cook them too much. The problem is that often fresh raspberries are not that great. IfI am making a sauce, even in the middle ofsummer I will use frozen raspberries. You can use frozen fruit as long as it doesn’t have sugar or anything else added. The fruit is picked in the field when it is ripe and frozen right away. So, the frozen raspberries will have better flavor than those that have been put in a little carton and shipped across the country. Of course, local fanners’ market raspberries are a different story. IfI am making a sauce in the summer, the frozen raspberries will taste great. On the other hand, you would not use frozen raspberries on top of a tart. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO",,,

I am from Northern Italy and grew up eating risotto. Back then, we mainly ate risotto Milanese [i.e., saffron risotto, traditionally served with osso buco or with a mild pork sausage crumbled in with some rosemary]. We would also put it in soup — or even just eat it simply with some grated cheese.
I love it because it only takes one pan, and it is ready in 20 minutes! People think it takes a long time but if you were to cook a piece of fish, wash greens, and make a salad dressing, that would take just as long.
You can make risotto with almost anything. I love it with fruit, vegetables, or fish. One of my favorite fruit risottos is a seasonal one with pears and Gorgonzola.
The pears give a nice, sweet crunch to the dish. I also like making risotto with Prosecco, strawberries, and nettles.
A classic combination in Italy in fall is game with blueberry jam and mushrooms.
I have adapted this and for over twenty years have been serving risotto with porcini mushrooms and blueberries tossed in at the last second.
I also like to make a risotto with fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or oregano — and then at the end I’ll cover it with an extra-thin slice of lard [pork jowl] that has a mild flavor. It just melts into the risotto and is out of this world.
Each ingredient you add to your risotto will dictate when it should be added. If it is something delicate like a berry, it gets added very late so it will not break up. If you are making a seafood risotto — say, with octopus — it should be added early so it has time to cook all the way through.",,,

"ROSE (Hips, Petals, Water)",Coment,"Floral flavors, when done well, can be really amazing. This is also special because it is something that I never grew up with. Someone from India may not find it a big deal. I tend to think in threes. I’ll pair two classic ingredients, and add a third to elevate the combination. I make my own rose-flavored dessert that was inspired by [French pastry chef] Pierre Herme and his rose macaroon with raspberry and lychee, which is one ofthe greatest things I have tasted in my life. I coat a standard tart shell with a layer ofliquid raspberry on top ofthat I place a rose parfait, which I pair with lemon and pistachio. To make the rose flavor not so overbearing, I use it in three different forms. I infuse rosebuds [used to make rosewater) in the milk for the parfait, and 1 also use rose syrup, which adds color and sweetness, and finally rosewater as well. You have to be careful with rose because it can be like eating perfume. That is why I take a lot ofcare using three layers to make it one flavor. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON

SAFFRON,Coment,"I would definitely have saffron on hand for Spanish cooking. It lends itselfto rice, seafood, meat, and poultry. You can combine saffron and salt together for a saffron salt that is incredibly aromatic. Saffron also works very well on a salad. People forget that saffron is a flower and, sprinkled on a salad, it aromatizes the greens. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFG ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
SAFFRON,Coment,"Saffron has a sweet power. It is a classic flavor to add to shellfish, but the minute you taste the saffron in a dish, there is too much. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
SAFFRON,Coment,"I wanted to come up with a panna cotta that was unlike anyone else’s. I
was walking down the street thinking of Italian dishes and risotto
Milanese [which is made with saffron] came to mind. This led me to
think about saffron, and the idea of adding saffron to my panna cotta.
After Ruth Reichl mentioned it in the New York Times review of Babbo,
Mario [Batali] told me I could never take it offthe menu!
Saffron has a bright metallic flavor, and with quince — which is
floral, delicate, and perfumed — it is wonderful. Over the years, I have
found that saffron unexpectedly changes its flavor depending on what
fruit is paired with it. Each fruit I work with either turns up its floral
component or its metallic flavor. Saffron is great with stone fruits like
apples, peaches, pears, plums, and figs. It also works with citrus like
blood oranges, kumquats, and grapefruit. On the other hand, it doesn’t
work with many berries. It makes strawberries a little flat, and is
downright awful with cranberries.

"SALADS (See also Lettuces and
other vegetables)",Coment,"Every salad should have elements ofbitter, salt, heat, and texture. For us, the bitter component is often the greens. We use a lot offrisee, radicchio, and endive. But there always needs to be some crunch in a salad. Even ifit is a delicate salad, you need to find a way to get a crunch in there. For a delicate salad, you can get crunch using fried shallot rings or crispy sage leaves. We often use nuts for crunch. Our leafsalad has a cashew brittle, which is made by caramelizing sugar then seasoning it with salt, black pepper, a hint ofmadras curry, a pinch of our Moroccan spice blend (eighteen ingredients), and a pinch ofpepper mix (four ingredients) before tossing the nuts in. The other components ofthe salad are pomegranate seeds, bacon, and a South American blue cheese. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",,,
"SALADS (See also Lettuces and
other vegetables)",Coment,"When you are eating a salad, the greens are the main ingredient, so whatever you add has to elevate them. Lettuce is boring by itself, so you elevate it with the vinaigrette. We will use herbs in our salads, but they must not overpower tire greens; they have to be very subtle and used in small amounts. We will use chives or fresh parsley leaves or a combination oftire two. We may also add some mint to the mix because it pushes the flavors ofthe greens. — ERIC RIPERT, IE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

The salmon is roasted, and served with warm, slightly charred cucumbers, which I like because they are rarely used cooked. We use market vegetables that right now are bok choy and peas. I have added some trout caviar for a briny flavor because salmon is on the sweet side. The dish is then finished with a hickory broth.
For the hickory broth, we smoke some hickory chips, wrap them in cheesecloth with juniper berries and peppercorns, and then submerge them in water to make a broth.
This creates a smoked sauce that is light and tasty. What we have here is a ""wood stock” that makes perfect sense with the salmon because so often salmon is smoked. 
After the wood comes out, you taste the broth to adjust it. It may need some more water to cut the wood and smoke flavor, or it might need to be reduced to intensify it. We finish the sauce with a little half-and-half, and foam it with a handheld mixer.",,,
"SALAAON (See also Fish —
In General)",Coment,"Vitaly Paley of Portland's Paley's Place on Cooking Salmon on a Plank

Salmon is a big part of cooking in the Northwest. We get ours anywhere from Oregon up to Alaska.
The first cooking process that comes to mind in this part of the country is called cedar planking, which is a Native American technique. You see planking in all the best cooking catalogs, but the problem is that you cook the fish, throw it out, and keep the plank because the plank is inevitably more expensive than the fish! So here is one tip: Instead, do what we do and go to a lumber yard and pick up untreated cedar shingles. They come in a huge bundle for $16.
To get the most out of plank cooking, the salmon needs to be brined or marinated. I have two favorite marinades — one that is wet, and one that is dry. The wet marinade is a 60/40 mixture of soy sauce and cream sherry, lots of sliced ginger, heads of garlic cut in half, and chopped scallions. The sherry adds just a touch of sweetness to the fish, which I like. Let the fish sit in that marinade for a couple of hours and then it is ready to take on the smoke.
The dry marinade is a more traditional marinade of a 60/40 ratio of brown sugar and salt with orange zest [grated] on a microplane [fine grater], I mix this all together and lavishly rub it over a salmon with the skin on, which protects it from getting too salty or sweet. The sugar in this rub balances out the salt and adds another dimension to the fish with caramelization happening a lot quicker. The sweetness is almost hidden; it is that ""What’s-that-flavor?"" aspect to the fish. Marinate for a couple of hours, then wipe off the rub slightly, and it is ready to go. The 60/40 ratio of sugar to salt is good because it is pretty forgiving if you leave the fish in the marinade a half hour too long.
I recommend brushing the plank lightly with some olive oil, throwing it on a hot grill, putting the fish on, and letting it catch on fire, because when the plank is on fire, that is the flavor you are looking for. When the burning plank gets close to the fish, cover the grill to smother the fire and let the smoke do the rest of the work",,Citrus,ORANGE
"SALAAON (See also Fish —

Because it is rich and fatty, it pairs well with everything from a red wine sauce to a simple vinaigrette. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
"SALAAON (See also Fish —
In General)",Coment,"Tomato and pineapple with salmon: This dish goes back to 1975 when someone gave me a salad oftomato and pineapple. I didn’t know what to do with it, so I stored the idea away. Today, I will cook the tomato, pineapple, a dash ofwhite wine for acid, miso, and the salmon head, which bridges and brings the flavors together. Tomato gets fruitier when cooked with pineapple. The end result doesn't taste like either tomato or pineapple; it is a new flavor. This sauce is perfect with salmon. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

"SALMON, SMOKED",Coment,"My signature sushi roll pairs salmon with mango puree and sushi rice. However, I wouldn’t serve salmon with mango puree as sashimi. Tire balance would be lost. Also, mango doesn’t pair well with either soy sauce or wasabi. — KAZ OKOCHI, KAZ SUSHI BISTRO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
"SALMON, SMOKED",Coment,"We roast salmon wrapped in squash blossom and it imparts a slight zucchini flavor to the salmon. The blossom is mild and makes a perfect package for the salmon by steaming it as it cooks. With the salmon we serve a [zucchini] squash cut into spaghetti seasoned with lemon thyme and basil. The herbs work with both the zucchini and the salmon. — JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",,Citrus,LEMON
"SALMON, SMOKED",Coment,"I love combining fruit and proteins. I am one-half Hawaiian, and in Hawaiian cooking a classic dish is Spam cooked with fresh pineapple. 1 grew up with my father making it for us, and it is delicious. You’ll also see a lot ofsushi chefs combine kiwi and scallops, as fruit adds a nice cleansing note to the protein you are working with. Our take on this combination is pineapple salmon with avocado and quinoa. We cut pineapple very thin, then wrap it around salmon belly, which is very rich. When we cook it, the pineapple gets caramelized and helps cut the fat ofthe salmon. On the dish is a sweet-hot sauce ofavocado, honey, scallions, and serrano chiles. To garnish the dish and add some crunch we add quinoa that is cooked then dried for three days before cooking it in olive oil, which makes it pufflike Rice Krispies. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,

SALTINESS,Coment,"If you have a piece ofIberico or Serrano ham in your refrigerator, you’ll eventually end up with this little end of dried-out salt-cured meat. While some might just throw it away, we know there’s a lot offlavor left — so we grind it up in a coffee grinder and use it as meat-flavored salt. We call this “ham salt,” and will use this on a salad to emphasize the aroma and flavor of pork. ... In Spain we have mojama, which is tuna loin cured like ham. We’ll grind it up in a coffee grinder and it becomes tuna salt. When I sear tuna, I will sprinkle this on and emphasize the tuna with its own tuna flavor. It is simple and dramatic. I even showed this technique to the owner ofthe best tuna restaurant in the world — called El Campero in Barbate, Spain — where he serves tuna a hundred ways. He loved it! — JOSE ANDRES, CAFt ATLANTIC© (WASHINGTON, DC)",INFO,,
SALTINESS,Coment,"We use three different kinds of salt — but we also use capers, anchovies, olives, preserved lemons, and even prosciutto for adding another dimension of saltiness.

SALTINESS,Coment,Chefs on Selecting and Using Salt,INFO,,
SALTINESS,Coment,"Kosher salt has larger, harder crystals and won't break down too fast. I use this for pasta water, brining, curing meat, and charcuterie. I use French sea salt (esp. Baleine) for general seasoning. I like Maldon salt a lot This is what I use for finishing dishes. It has a really fine crystal and the flavor is great It even gives some crunch and melts like snowflakes. It is great sprinkled on raw fish. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,
SALTINESS,Coment,"Salt is now used very often in desserts and unfortunately it doesn't always make sense. I was served a green apple sorbet with salt and it didn't work. Salt does work on sweet oranges, though. If you cut a Cara Cara orange into wedges and sprinkle sea salt on them, they are delicious. Salt also makes sense with caramel and butterscotch. The salt is a contrast to the super sweet, which is why we like PayDay candy bars. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY",INFO,Citrus,ORANGE
SALTINESS,Coment,"I use Maldon salt flakes as a salt for finishing dishes, and kosher salt for blanching water or when I roast on salt. I'll sometimes use smoked salt with raw fish or in a brine for pork, but it's really strong so you have to be careful with it — BRADFORD THOMPSON, MARY ELAINE'S AT THE PHOENICIAN (SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA)",INFO,,
SALTINESS,Coment,"There is salt in almost all of my desserts. However, you would not know it was there until I took it out — which is how it should be. You don't need to taste the salt, but it helps open the palate and stimulates your taste buds. With something fatty like chocolate, you need some salt to brighten it up. I use all sorts of salts with my desserts. We are making a peanut butter and jelly bonbon that I pair with smoked Brittany sea salt. Maldon salt is shaved and more about texture, because it is not as strong; I would use it on a pancake or something creamy. Fleur de sei is a salt with texture and ocean floral notes, and would go well on our panini which have cheese, arugula, and vinaigrette. — JOHNNY IUZZINI, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,
SALTINESS,Coment,"Salt goes into almost every dough we make and is something that makes flavors pop. Some chefs can go a little overboard, but desserts should still be sweet. Salt works well with caramel and chocolate, obviously. I also use a vanilla salt with a classic sweet potato tart that is cut into four slices with a few grains on each slice. The salt reinforces the savoriness of the sweet potato and plays off the brightness of the preserved lemon on the plate. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SALTINESS,Coment,"To counteract oversaltinga dish, you need to increase the volume of whatever you are making. That can be tricky, because you don't want to end up with something too watery. Whenever there is a puree involved, whether it is mashed potatoes or butternut squash soup, I encourage my cooks to make it thick. You can always add, but not take away. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,

"SAVORY",Flavor Affinities,"Savory in any form — whether summer or winter savory — is my favorite herb. It is not as woody as thyme, not as piney as rosemary, and not as pungent as sage. It also has the ability to stay flavorful throughout the cooking process. I like it with potatoes, with polenta, and with mushrooms. Savory and mushrooms are great. I especially like grilled porcini mushrooms with savory. I'll grill the mushrooms then put them on a bed ofsavory to finish roasting them. Savory also works in a sherry or red wine vinaigrette with shallots, and is great on salads. — VITALY PALEY, PALEY'S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)",,,

SCALLOPS,Coment,"We have served cinnamon-dusted sea scallops, and they were very tasty. — MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)",,,
SCALLOPS,Coment,"You’ll find sushi chefs combining scallops with kiwi. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
SCALLOPS,Coment,"We offer GulfofMaine sea scallops scented with citrus, spices, and vanilla bean, caramelized Belgian endive, ruby red grapefruit, mache, and mint. The dish came about because I love vanilla and grapefruit. I came up with the idea that I would use dry citrus to powder my scallops. Then I realized that was just one note, so I added some spice which led to star anise, fennel, and anise seed. I sauce the dish with a beurre blanc and grapefruit syrup made offresh grapefruit, candied peel, and fresh vanilla bean. Since the sauce has butter and cream, I had to be careful not to turn this into vanilla creme brulee! I love caramelized endive because you have a bitter vegetable that you make sweet. We cook it in whole butter and just as it starts to brown we sprinkle in sugar. This balances the tart and sweet ofthe grapefruit and the sweetness ofthe scallops. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)",,Citrus,
SCALLOPS,Coment,"Sear scallops on one side only, or else they'll be overcooked. Accent them with coconut milk, garlic, ginger, or lemongrass. Or, puree sea scallops with cream and cook them slowly in a double boiler, which gives them the appearance ofwhite scrambled eggs. This pairs beautifully with caviar, chopped raw onion, or truffles. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON. DC)",,Citrus,LEMON
SCALLOPS,Coment,"Scallops with chanterelles and green parsley sauce is as beautiful on the plate as it is on the palate. — HIRO SONE, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)",,,
SCALLOPS,Coment,"Nantucket bay scallops are magically delicious, and pairing them with duck fat is an unusual combination that works. It is essentially scallops Provencal, but instead ofusing olive oil you use duck fat that gives you a silky quality. It is an enormously fun dish to cook and you use your eyes and nose to cook it. You heat up duck fat, getting it really hot, then saute the scallops really fast. After taking them out, add chopped garlic and tomato concasse. It moves along quickly, hit it with chicken stock, adjust it with some lemon juice, and let it reduce and emulsify You add your scallops back in with some chiffonade of basil and it’s done. The dish smells so good while you’re cooking it, between the garlic, the scallops, and the duck fat. The whole thing is done in one shot. No resting, no slicing, no elaborate plating. It’s fun, and its delicious. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON

SKATE,Coment,"Sage goes really well with skate — it gives the skate a masculine touch.
— ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
SKATE,Coment,"I make a sauteed skate dish that is basically a version oflinguini with white clam sauce. The sauce with the skate is made from the juice from the clams, garlic, anchovy, and olive oil and it is finished with a parsley puree. With the fish I also serve angel hair pasta. All these flavors are what you will find in white clam sauce, but are just served in a different form. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
SKATE,Coment,"We still have the same philosophy as when we opened: The fish is still the star ofthe plate. We have not budged from there, but every dish has a sauce that completes the dish, and brings together all the elements on the plate and creates harmony. We pay homage to seafood and are dedicated to it, but use a wide palette from rich sauces to broths and a variety ofspices and emulsions. What makes a dish work is the way we make and treat our sauce. We don’t make a sauce in the morning and use it for the day. Can you imagine ifyou made coffee in the morning and came back at noon to taste it? It would be disgusting. The same for tea: ifyou left a tea bag in your tea all day, at night it would be awful. We used to make a garlic sage broth and I found it to be very volatile. I realized that the sauce is really only good for three minutes. After that, the sage kills the garlic or vice versa and the sauce loses its balance. What we ended up doing is making a base with chicken stock, then using a tea bag with ingredients in it to infuse the sauce, and we serve it right away. This sauce is paired with skate roasted in goose fat with green peppercorns. On the side we serve artichokes with pistachios and Parmesan cheese. — ERIC RIPERT, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

SOURNESS,Coment,"I like galangal, lemongrass, and ginger. They all have natural acidity and zingy spice that will perk anything up. Even ifyou are not adding [a liquid] acid to coconut milk but add aromatics instead, your dish won’t taste heavy. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SOURNESS,Coment,"A defining factor for American cooks is hitting high notes with acidic tones. Using acidity to create brightness in dishes stands out from the cooking I did in France. French cooking is all about harmony, while American cooking is about hitting the high notes. In American fine dining, you have to have some boundaries with your acidity because you are working with wine. It is important to hit the high notes but you have to do it without destroying the wine pairing. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,
SOURNESS,Coment,"Almost every dish has to have some sort of acid, or else it will taste flat. It is a question oftaste — some chefs like sour, some like sweet — and there is no right or wrong. Lemon juice is used in small amounts to bring out other flavors. I use all kinds ofvinegars — banyuls, red wine, rice wine, and sherry, just to name a few. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SOURNESS,Coment,"I have a cupboard full of acids! Every culture is doing the same thing when it comes to using acid in its food: it is all about enhancing flavor without adding salt. We use a lot ofcitrus, whether it is lemon, lime, or something else. When I lived in England, they joked with me because I would add orange juice to almost everything, especially vinaigrettes. I really like its acidity and the light, fruity flavor it adds. On a totally different end ofthe spectrum is tamarind. We always have tamarind water in our refrigerator and use it to finish sauces. Depending on the country ofinspiration, I will use a different acid: for India, tamarind; Japan, ponzu, yuzu; Middle East, sumac, preserved lemon, and yogurt; and for Southeast Asia, lemon, lime, and tamarind. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SOURNESS,Coment,"I select my acids as carefully as I select my sweeteners. I could use lemon juice for everything, but in some cases, verjus will add a brightness that balsamic or sherry vinegar won’t. I love veijus and have served it alone as a sorbet. I have also served it with apple and pears. I like ice wine vinegar with roasting fruits. Aged balsamic vinegar isn’t shocking anymore — it is great straight over fruit or added to an ice cream. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SOURNESS,Coment,"When you add acid to a sauce, it lifts everything up. Lemon is my favorite; I use lemon and orange the way a chefuses salt and pepper. Whether I add the juice, zest, or confit depends on the cooking application:",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SOURNESS,Coment,"• Juice: If a recipe calls for water, why use that? Why not add flavor and use orange juice?
• Zest: IfI make panna cotta, it will have orange zest in it but it will not taste orangey. IfI make a cake, I also use zest 
• Confit: I use this most often as a garnish. 
— MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,Citrus,ORANGE
SOUS-VIDE COOKING,Coment,"What sous-vide [“under vacuum”] cooking does is give you a long, very controlled cooking time. I like to use it on vegetables because no air hits the vegetable. All the white vegetables come out really white. It also keeps the whiteness in fruits like apples and pears. — DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
SOUS-VIDE COOKING,Coment,"Instead ofsous-vide, with poultry I'll use a poaching technique I learned from my grandmother: I’ll cover a whole chicken or turkey or pheasant with cold liquid, mirepoix, garlic, and herbs; cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid; bring it to a boil; drop it to a simmer; and then turn it off. This technique creates a vacuum seal that transfers all the flavor into the chicken. It’s ten times better than straight poaching, because you don’t lose any moisture. I’ll serve the chicken cold with a hot ginger sauce that’s two parts fresh ginger to one part each garlic, scallions, and cilantro. I heat oil to smoking, pour it over the herbs, and serve the hot ginger-herb sauce over the cold poached chicken. It’s delicious. — TONY LIU, AUGUST (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

SOY SAUCE,Coment,"I add soy sauce to my onion soup because it gives it a meaty flavor. I use so much soy sauce at home my kid is starting to look Asian! — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
SOY SAUCE,Coment,"White soy sauce is something I fell in love with while cooking in Japan for two years. It is like liquid smoke. It is not really soy sauce, but more of a brewed wheat product. It has a smoky quality, too, but it is still so light you can use it on hamachi with sesame seeds and olive oil. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
SOY SAUCE,Coment,"White soy sauce is lighter on the palate and has a cleaner, more direct flavor than regular soy sauce. Regular soy sauce has a touch of caramel for color, flavor, and body, which makes it more a part ofthe dish rather than simply enhancing the ingredient. White soy sauce will let the ingredient sing. It is very pale, and if you make a ponzu sauce with mirin and rice wine vinegar, you’ll get something almost clear. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

SPANISH CUISINE,Coment,Spain in the New World: How American Chefs Are Influenced by Spain,CUISINE,,
SPANISH CUISINE,Coment,"Sweet Potato, Feta, and Smoked Paprika Tortilla with Minted Lemon Raita: We looked at Spain and the tortilla as the starting point for this dish. A traditional tortilla is made all together in one pan, but we played with that a little. We roast our sweet potatoes first with spicy-smoky paprika that tempers the sweetness with the heat and aromatic smokiness. We add feta cheese for the salt factor and caramelized onion for another layer of flavor. We then mix up a bunch of eggs, combine everything together, and cook it tortilla-style in a hot pan with a lot of olive oil on the stove and then in the oven to finish cooking. When we serve it, we cut it tortilla-style in a wedge and serve it at room temperature. The idea of eggs and potatoes always feels a bit heavy, which is why there is a zesty yogurt on the plate along with a crunchy watercress salad. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,Citrus,LEMON
SPANISH CUISINE,Coment,"Hearts of Romaine and Treviso Radicchio with Spanish Serrano Ham, Manchego Cheese and White Anchovies, Fire-Roasted Peppers and Crisp Capers: This dish is an homage to Guillermo, who supplies ourSpanish products. His anchovies are so good that ifsomeone asks for them on the side, the waiter just replies, ""Trust me. . . ."" The reason there is radicchio on the salad is because I like to change people's opinions of ingredients that have been wronged. When it is added to this salad, it is so good you can't believe it It adds a wonderful crunch and balances the romaine and other flavors. I add the fried capers to add some acidity and crunch. — CARRIE NAHABEDIAN, NAHA (CHICAGO)",CUISINE,,
SPANISH CUISINE,Coment,"In Spain, eggs aren’t eaten for breakfast; they are more for dinner. The Spanish also don't eat brunch, but at Tia Pol, brunch is a way to celebrate the Spanish egg cookery that is a huge part of their diet. The Spanish cook eggs beautifully and in a huge variety. In the Basque country, they really value a soft scrambled egg with a great ingredient in it — whether tiny mushrooms, asparagus, or baby pink shrimp. The Spanish also cook eggs in olive oil. When we serve a fried egg, we cook it in so much oil it is almost deep-fried; instead of using a spatula, we use a spider [a weblike wire mesh strainer] to remove the egg from the pan. — ALEXANDRA RAD, TlA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,
SPANISH CUISINE,Coment,"We use olive oil as a condiment. In Spain it is not uncommon to see something swimming in olive oil. Anchovies will be covered in oil, and after you eat the anchovies you just dip your bread in the oil. Even a dish that is cooked in olive oil will get a drizzle of raw oil on top for finishing. In Spanish cooking it is hard for me to name a dish that doesn't get olive oil. We will cook mushrooms in olive oil and serve them with oil on top. Sauteed vegetables in Spain may get cooked in a little pork fat and then served with diced ham on top. The Spanish also like to braise vegetables, and will add a ham end similar to a trotter [pig's foot] during the cooking. Any pot of stew or beans, such as garbanzos, will get ham added to it as well. What the ham end adds to what is being cooked is a little funky flavor but in a good way — like the flavor mold adds to a cheese. — ALEXANDRA RAIJ, TlA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",CUISINE,,
"SPICES (See also individual spices)",Coment,"Just a pinch ofspices such as fennel, coriander, cumin, and cayenne is great for finishing a sauce. Cayenne is great ifyou want to raise the heat level. You want to use only a pinch so that you don’t even know it is there. Ifyou are making a French lemon sauce with beurre blanc, lemon puree, and diced lemon zest, adding a pinch of cayenne will bring up the flavor without making it spicy. — ANDREW CARMELLINI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON
"SPICES (See also individual spices)",Coment,"I am sure every kitchen has its own pepper mix that is not just pepper. We have a mix that is specific for meat and occasionally for pork or tuna. It is a combination ofblack peppercorns, pink peppercorns, coriander seeds, and toasted ground star anise. The other thing I always have next to me is a tray we call “the four seasons"": Jleur de sei; red pepper flakes — the ultimate marriage ofheat and fruit; dry mustard, which I use all the time; and sumac, for an acidic component. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",SPICE,,
"SPICES (See also individual spices)",Coment,"To counteract overspicing, you need to increase the quantity of whatever you are making. This is a case where you might want to add a puree ofsomething, or add some sweetness because sweetness balances spice. With an Indian curry that is too powerful, you could puree some dried apricot into it. The apricot puree adds sweetness, binds the sauce, and increases the overall quantity. — ANDREW CARMELUNI, A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)",SPICE,,

I like to add some garlic to it, and from there you can go almost anywhere. Sauteed spinach is delicious with a poached egg. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
SPINACH (See also Greens — In General),Coment,"Spinach and bacon is simply a great combination. The key to our creamed spinach is that we steam our fresh-leafspinach just until it wilts, then drain it and chop it slightly. [In a pan,] we start with a little butter and flour to thicken, then add cream, nutmeg, and an onion pique [an onion spiked with cloves], and reduce the cream by half. Then we add the barely cooked spinach to the cream and heat them together briefly so just a little juice infiltrates the cream. You end up with velvety spinach, which we top with [chunks of] Nueske’s bacon, which is an applewood-smoked bacon from the Midwest. — MICHAEL LOMONACO, PORTER HOUSE NEW YORK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"I remember asking myself, How can I make a salad into a dessert? The result of my experimentation bore no resemblance to a salad: I used olive oil to make an almondfinancier, because a financier is not a financier without the brown butter, I substituted olive oil for halfthe brown butter. I served this with a balsamic vinegar ice cream, and a basil-infused strawberry consomme. A note about the strawberries is that I cooked them on very low heat. It comes from the idea of gentleness, slowness, care, respect for the ingredients, and, in the end, a better-tasting fresh ingredient. 1 could have extracted more juice from the strawberries by bringing them up to a boil with a bunch ofsugar, but that results in cooked strawberries and not the fresh strawberry flavor you're after. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"A tiny bit ofvanilla makes strawberries yummy! It has to be just a little because you don’t want a vanilla-strawberry dessert; you want a strawberry dessert that has a little vanilla on the palate that people have to search for. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"You still can’t go wrong with a classic. For years I tried to come up with the end-all be-all strawberry dessert. Four years ago, I said forget it — the strawberries I get from my purveyor in the farmers’ market are perfect. Now, I serve strawberry gelato with lots ofstrawberries and 25-year-old balsamic vinegar. It became an injustice to try to do anything else with the perfect strawberries I was getting. — GINA DEPALMA, BA8BO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"Strawberries pair beautifully with Cabernet Sauvignon, and black pepper takes tire combination even further. — LISSA DOUMANI, TERRA (ST. HELENA, CALIFORNIA)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"When I taste strawberries at the store I close my eyes and ask, Is this a [perfect] strawberry or does this need a little help? Ifthey are a little dry, to help them, you cook them on top ofthe stove a little and that will release their perfume and juice. You can add Grand Marnier or Kirsch, which will help their flavor as well. Ifyou follow these steps, though, this will lead you to wanting to serve them warm. Ifyou chill them down, they will not look great. So I would serve a warm berry compote over vanilla ice cream. Ifyou have some berries that aren’t perfect, with a little love and attention they’ll adapt. In spring, when the strawberries are early and not that good, I’ll roast them in the oven with red wine, balsamic vinegar, sugar, com syrup, and water, and they turn wonderfully jammy. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"I love fresh strawberries with dense and dry cow’s milk cheeses, such as Queso de los Beyos from Spain. It hits your tongue like dry plaster, then melts, releasing its slightly sour fresh milk flavor. Both also go very well with rose Champagne. — ADRIAN MURCIA, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
STRAWBERRIES,Coment,"Strawberries have a rose note to them so I find rose geraniums bring that out. The two have similar flavors. —JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",,,

SUMMER,Coment,"My favorite fruit to work with is a toss-up between all ofthe stone fruits [i.e., cherries, plums, apricots, nectarines, and peaches]. Late July, August, and September is my favorite time ofyear! — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,
SUMMER,Coment,"When I compose a dish, I work with the season — but like to play with that as well. People will ask how we can have braised short ribs on the menu in summer. I can, because I play with the other elements ofthe dish. For example, I pair seared watermelon with my short ribs for a refreshing note. From this base, I add other elements to lighten the dish further. The dish also has watermelon radishes that are bright green on the outside and red on the inside so you get another take on “watermelon on watermelon.” The radish also adds a little heat and freshness to cut the richness ofthe short ribs. The last note in the dish is feta cheese, which adds overall creaminess and goes back to the combination ofwatermelon and feta that you see in Greek restaurants. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",INFO,,
SUMMER,Coment,"What 1 like about working with the seasons is that everything that is in season at the same time works together. During the summer when you have tomatoes, melon, and basil, you can make a dish with them and it wall work. [His menu includes a salad of grilled watermelon with tomatoes, basil, and aged balsamic.] I don’t try to create new combinations ofingredients. I saw the combination oftomatoes and basil everywhere I ever worked. Should I do something different with tomatoes? No — why? The reason everyone serves this combination is because it is amazing! My approach is to find a new way to serve the tomatoes or the basil. I may make a tomato gazpacho and serve it with basil sorbet, or I could serve different preparations oftomatoes on the plate — fresh, a confit, a juice — and then do the same with the basil, serving it as an oil or a puree. — DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,
SUMMER,Coment,"Look at the weather and the occasion. You want your dessert to match the style and appropriateness ofthe meal. Ifit is a barbecue in the summer, I would serve a fruit crisp or pie, summer pudding, or ice cream, and that is pretty much it. People always talk about using fresh and local ingredients, which is very important. But, ifyou are using chocolate, which is available year-round, and ifit is 85 degrees out with 85 percent humidity, the last thing you want is a hot chocolate souffle. You want chocolate ice cream instead. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",INFO,,
SUMMER,Coment,"Summer vegetables work with summer herbs. In the Northwest, you will see the same set ofingredients in season in the same week every year. So, you just put them together. For example, sockeye salmon comes into season [during the summer] when squash does, and so do the herbs used in a fines herbes mixture. There’s your dish! — JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",INFO,,

SWEETNESS,Coment,"At dessert time, you don’t have the same philosophy as you do at the beginning ofthe meal. You don't want people coming back for more — you want to finish them off! Dessert is the easy course, because sweetness is easy and obvious. I don't want big structure; the work is done. As long as the apple tastes like apple, you are there! A dessert is about manipulating the sugar in some way to bring out the best ofthe apple, chocolate, lemon, pecans, or whatever you are working with. From there, you want to balance the sugar with the fat to bring out the best ofthe star ingredient. I am not a pastry chef, so I try to stick to simple things, like chocolate pot de creme and lemon pudding. The key is that, though they may be simple, I always use very good ingredients. — SHARON HAGE, YORK STREET (DALLAS)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON
SWEETNESS,Coment,"I’m not such a fan ofwhite sugar because it only adds sweetness and little sophistication. Maple, honey, or brown sugar add so much more. When making a baba in France, you use only sugar and water. I use molasses because it gives texture and sweetness. In France you use a lot ofsimple syrup. I like to use orange juice instead ofwater, and instead of using white sugar, I’ll use brown. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",INFO,Citrus,ORANGE
SWEETNESS,Coment,"I love jaggery [the unrefined sugar used in India, also known as palm sugar] because it has a fermented flavor and provides more complexity. Dates can be a primary source ofsweetness in a dessert instead of sugar, as can vegetables such as beets, carrots, parsnips, and corn, which all have an earthy sweetness. However, I don’t want to pound people over the head with a beet sorbet. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",INFO,,

TARRAGON,Coment,"The flavor oftarragon is fabulous. You get the flavor of Provence and of fennel ... it is wonderful. I use it a lot, but you have to be careful. Most people chop tarragon too thin and it oxidizes before it goes into the dish. You want to just cut it into three pieces, and that’s it. Chop, chop, chop — that's it. Otherwise, between the knife and the cutting board, it will oxidize and give the herb a bad taste. — MICHEL RICHARD, CITRONELLE (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
TARRAGON,Coment,"I like tarragon when it is used in moderation. It is a fairly particular and strong herb, and for that reason it doesn’t have the same applications as other herbs. It is good in a lot ofthings, such as with fish and chicken — and you can’t make bearnaise without it! — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
TARRAGON,Coment,"Tarragon is my all-time favorite herb. I like the licorice flavor and the light perfume ofthe herb. This is an herb that marries well with other flavors. We serve a dish right now offlounder, white corn, and sugar snap peas with tarragon butter that is delicious. — MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)",,,
TARRAGON,Coment,"Tarragon is best on its own [as opposed to combined with other herbs], . . . Tarragon works with muskmelon. — JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",,,
TECHNIQUES,Coment,"We believe that food preparation is 60 percent ingredients and 40 percent technique. — DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY, WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)",,,
TECHNIQUES,Coment,"I find it a bit ofa nightmare to find quality fruit and vegetables in this country. I think that for this reason technique began to be the primary driving force for a new dish. — HESTON BLUMENTHAL, THE FAT DUCK (ENGLAND)",,,

THYME,Coment,"Thyme works well with so many things, especially soups and stews. I can’t think of anything that it wouldn’t work with ifused properly. It is often a supporting-role herb and not the star; it is not an herb that bangs you over the head. — DAVID WALTUCK, CHANTERELLE (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
THYME,Coment,"This is one ofthose cases where I remember the first time I ever tasted thyme. I’d ordered a cup ofreal clam chowder in Newport, Rhode Island, and found out that fresh thyme was the secret to it being the best I had tasted at the time. I still use thyme in my chowder to this day, though now I use dried thyme. You would have to use a considerable amount offresh thyme to get the flavor ofthe dried. — MARCEL DESAULNIERS, THE TRELLIS (WILLIAMSBURG, VIRGINIA)",,,
THYME,Coment,"Thyme works well with citrus and honey. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
THYME,Coment,"In Spanish cooking, thyme is used very lightly. You will just toss a sprig in something. You don’t want it to be strong; it is just a note. 1 use it when making escabeche [marinated poached or fried fish] or when cooking beans. — ALEXANDRA RAIL, TlA POL (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

TOMATOES,Coment,"Gazpacho is awesome. As a restaurant chef, I can’t just make gazpacho. I have to do something that you can’t do at home, but that is interesting — and not in a weird way. We use the ingredients that you would find in gazpacho but instead of using only tomatoes, we will use 80 percent strawberries and 20 percent tomatoes. My gazpacho is made up oftoasted country bread, cucumber, bell pepper, a little garlic, strawberries, tomatoes, olive oil, and white balsamic vinegar. The dish is then garnished with Hawaiian blue prawns, diced strawberries, and slices ofguanciale (cured pork jowl), olive oil, basil, and black pepper. — DANIEL HUMM, ELEVEN MADISON PARK (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
TOMATOES,Coment,"My parents had a large garden with almost 120 tomato plants. I would go out in the garden and pick a tomato and eat it like an apple. I love, heirloom tomato season. I like to serve them with a little salt and pepper, a drizzle oflemon juice or cider vinegar, and a piece of mozzarella cheese. You need to taste your tomatoes before you season them. Yellow tomatoes are pretty sweet, which is why I like to add a little vinegar. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

Northwest truffles are very good for what they are. What they are not is French or Italian truffles, which are stronger. Northwest truffles pair really well with celery root puree. We serve a ravioli filled with celery root and an egg yolk. The egg yolk is raw when the ravioli is cooked; when it is served, the dish is topped with butter and shaved truffle.
The white truffles are milder than the black. I especially like the white truffles with seafood such as shellfish, especially crab. They also work with root vegetables and potatoes.
The black truffles are a little funkier, and work with red meats and game birds.
We like to prepare melted leeks, which are leeks cooked in water until they are incredibly soft, which then get a shaving of black truffle and are served with wagu beef.",,,

TURBOT,Coment,"When I create a dish, I start with the fish and ask, What is the inspiration ofthe moment? I will choose a culture and start there. For a recent dish, I was in a Japanese mood and wanted something light and refined. I used a piece ofturbot and paired it with miso and mushroom broth. The mushrooms don’t relate so much to the culture
but the miso definitely does. I created a lemon miso paste with white miso and lemon confit. The fish would sit on the paste and at the last second the waiter would add the mushroom broth. If you add the broth too soon, the miso kills the mushroom flavors
— eric ripert, le bernardin (new york city)",,Citrus,LEMON
TURBOT,Coment,"Turbot is a beautiful, delicate fish that calls to mind special occasions and celebrations. It poaches well, and takes on richer garnishes such as caviar or truffles
— Bradford Thompson, mary elaine'S at the Phoenician (Scottsdale, Arizona)",,,
TURBOT,Coment,"When you get in fresh turbot, you automatically think ofpairing it with delicate flavors. It is like looking at the Queen of England: You look at it with unbelievable respect, and there is no way you are going to overload this delicate piece offish. I like turbot with a nage with periwinkles, chervil, and parsley puree. Or I’ll make it with tiny pearl onions with a drizzle ofred wine reduction made from the bones ofthe turbot.

"TURMERIC",Coment,"Fresh turmeric gives you fruitiness and upfront flavor, plus a touch of acid that perks up a dish. Ifyou add fresh turmeric to your curry, you will make a world of difference. When you smell the powdered stuff, it smells like nothing. Dried turmeric hurts me. It hurts the soul. It is really not what turmeric is. Unfortunately, frozen turmeric isn't a good substitute, either. You have to use it fresh. — BRAD FARMERIE, PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
"TURMERIC",Coment,"Turmeric is always tire first spice I add to a curry, like the primer on a canvas. The amount ofturmeric controls tire entire path that curry will take. I cook in layers offlavor, so only when I am happy with the aroma ofone layer will I then add ingredients to create the next layer. I fI am making curry, the pan will have onions, garlic, and tomatoes, and then the very first thing to go in is the turmeric. IfI use a lot ofturmeric, it’s destined to be a richer-spiced curry, as I’ll also have to put in more of all the other spices to balance the flavors. — MEERU DHALWALA, VU'S (VANCOUVER)",,,

"VANILLA",Coment,"I always overlooked vanilla when I was growing up. After I made my first vanilla ice cream, however, it was no longer just “the white one”! I like the nuances that different kinds ofvanilla offer. Working at Le Bemardin where quality is paramount, for our ice cream it has to be Tahitian. When vanilla is the star, this is the bean you choose. It has an interesting woody, cherrylike flavor to it that I just love. Bourbon vanilla is a great workhorse bean that does well in a supporting role. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
"VANILLA",Coment,"IfI poach a pear, I will always add vanilla. Vanilla also pairs really well with sweet herbs, especially tarragon and bay leaf. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,
"VANILLA",Coment,"So many dessert recipes call for vanilla that it is like salt for dessert. But sometimes it doesn’t have a place and can muck up things. Vanilla should be the star ofthe show. I love vanilla in dairy desserts. I do a vanilla bean Bavarese (an Italian Bavarian cream) that I serve with brown butter and bay leaf.

VINEGAR — IN GENERAL,Coment,"I use a variety ofvinegars and right now I am using cider vinegar, balsamic, and white balsamic. What vinegar you grab really depends on how far you can push the product. When we make a walnut sauce, it can handle a good-sized dash of cider vinegar. In a fluke tartare, we’ll only use a drop ofvinegar. — MICHAEL ANTHONY, GRAMERCY TAVERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

"VINEGAR, CHAMPAGNE",Coment,"Sorbet is about pure flavor and should be a very intense experience of the fruit’s flavor. You can jack up the flavor ofyour sorbet by choosing the correct acid to balance it. For example, lemon juice is really strong. Ifyou have sweet sorbet, you can add a ton oflemon juice that will balance the sweetness but give you a lemon dessert. For some sorbets, I prefer to use champagne vinegar. It is light and easy to use. Vinegar is a more potent fruity acid, so you can use less and bring up the fruit of your dessert. I use champagne vinegar for mango or raspberry sorbet. It is made from grapes, which are berries, and is a natural for berry desserts — berries with berries. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,LEMON

It is not just when it is used in salads, but it is also the spark that makes gazpacho the unique soup it is. It is the spark that makes a humble lentil stew made with carrots, garlic, onion, and water a new thing. At the end, you add just a touch ofvinegar and you have this wonderful flavor that sparkles. . . . We have made sorbet out ofsherry vinegar and what you get is something that makes ""the king ofrefreshing” even more refreshing! You can go either savory or sweet with this sorbet: You could serve orange segments with the sherry sorbet on top, a touch of olive oil, an anchovy, a couple ofblack olives, and you have a salad. Or you could take the same oranges, add a touch ofhoney on top, manchego cheese, the sherry vinegar sorbet, and have a sweet dessert. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFS ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,ORANGE

VODKA,Coment,"Using vodka as a base spirit in a cocktail makes it drier, while propelling flavors and knitting them together. ... I love the combination ofChopin vodka, carrot juice, lemon thyme.

WATERMELON,Coment,"Lemony herbs like basil or anise hyssop work with watermelon. — JERRY TRAUNFELD, THE HERBFARM (WOODINVILLE, WASHINGTON)",,Citrus,LEMON
WATERMELON,Coment,"I started working on my watermelon salad years ago at Jean Georges restaurant. It started out as a watermelon and goat cheese salad for summertime. The dish was a very refreshing summer dish with the rich goat cheese and the fresh sweet watermelon. You felt like you were eating in a garden! It then went on to become watermelon with fresh tomatoes, but I still wasn’t happy with it. The texture ofthe tomato didn’t work with the texture ofthe watermelon. I then turned the tomatoes into a confit, cooking them in the oven over two hours with olive oil to concentrate their flavor. The dish is now watermelon, with a layer oftomato confit, topped with pistachios that just get browned in the oven, then a drizzle of olive oil and salt and pepper. The whole thing is then flashed in the oven for just a minute or two to warm it. Just before serving it gets a drizzle ofbalsamic vinegar. It is not only a beautiful play offlavors, but ofcolors as well. — GABRIEL KREUTHER, THE MODERN (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

WINTER,Matching,"With my desserts, I focus on chocolate all year round, but use it even more in winter. In California, the fruit is so wonderful in the summer that that is the place to focus. In summer, I can write my whole menu and forget chocolate — that is how good the fruit is here! In winter, it is the opposite. There are not eight unique things to focus on. So chocolate comes into play because it is a real comfort food and warming, too. Winter with its cool nights becomes souffle season. Winter is when all the special citrus fruits are available. Thank God for that, because you can work with Cara Cara oranges, lemon, and tropical fruits like passion fruit. Mangoes are available year-round, but winter is when I use them because there’s no competition from berries and other summer fruits. What is great about the tropical fruits in winter is that they also bring color to the menu. Pies and tarts work year-round because you can put anything in them, from chocolate to fruit. — EMILY LUCHETTI, FARALLON (SAN FRANCISCO)",INFO,Citrus,LEMON

YOGURT,Coment,"One ofmy favorite desserts is Greek yogurt, warm caramel sauce, and aged, 25-year-old balsamic vinegar. The yogurt is really rich and not too acidic. On the yogurt, I put a salty pine nut brittle, and then the drizzle ofvinegar. It works because ofthe beautiful balance ofsalt, sweet, and acid. — GINA DEPALMA, BABBO (NEW YORK CITY)",,,

YUZU FRUIT,Coment,"Fresh yuzu is expensive, so I use yuzu juice to add acid to a dish. It is great on seafood. It is not as pungent as lime, and has a little sweetness to it. When you put it on something hot like fish, it also brings out its floral notes. — KATSUYA FUKUSHIMA, MINIBAR (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,LIME
YUZU FRUIT,Coment,"I had just come back from Japan and was inspired, so I made a yuzu curd served with green tea ice cream. The dish has some small bit players like segments ofgrapefruit which I have always liked with green tea. When you have a perfect grapefruit, it is a little bitter and sweet, just like green tea. Grapefruit reinforces the yuzu because though it is citrus it is a very different flavored citrus. I’ll be honest — it looks cool as well, with the pink and green being served together. For texture I add caramelized Rice Krispies. This makes it a homage to Japan: You have rice, green tea, yuzu, and a little ginger caramel. — MICHAEL LAISKONIS, LE BERNARDIN (NEW YORK CITY)",,Citrus,
YUZU FRUIT,Coment,"Just like the lemon that is often served on the side with grilled fish, just a splash ofyuzu juice makes a lot ofthings delightful. I love both its aroma and flavor with lighter fish, such as flounder, fluke, and scallops. I recently went to a restaurant where a young chefwas trying to be creative, and he paired sweet shrimp with scallion oil, which hid the flavors ofthe shrimp. I tried to politely suggest that he try yuzu juice instead, which would bring out the sweetness ofthe sweet shrimp. — KAZ OKOCHI, KAZ SUSHI BISTRO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,Citrus,LEMON

She peels the zucchini and boils them in water, then purees them with a little ofthe water and adds a white cheese like goat or Philadelphia [cream cheese], then some olive oil and salt. It is amazing! It is creamy, velvety, and refined. We cook the zucchini and use the cooking water to make a gelatin. Then we take the white zucchini meat and make a mousse with olive oil. So the bottom ofthe dish is the mousse, then a layer ofseeds — cleaned one by one, which is very labor intensive — then a layer of gelatin that is topped with Spanish caviar. Tine dish is sweet and savory, and we are proud ofits simplicity [oftaste]. — JOSE ANDRES, CAFE ATLANTICO (WASHINGTON, DC)",,,
